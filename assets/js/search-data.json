Like most such tools,  Dendron supports all the usual features you would expect like tagging, backlinks, a graph view, split panes, and so forth. But it doesn't stop there - whereas most tools (try to make it) easy to **get notes in**, they tend to make it **hard to get them back out** later, and it only **gets worse as you add more notes**. Dendron helps you **get notes back out** and **works better** the **more notes you have**.\n\nI originally created Dendron because I'd accumulated over **20k notes** on programming and various other topics and couldn't find a tool that would let me easily add and find notes from within my knowledge base. \n\nTraditional note-taking tools are often **too rigid** by having an in-flexible hierarchy that doesn't let you file a note in multiple places. Newer tools are **too flexible** by eschewing hierarchies altogether in favour of relying solely on backlinks. \n\nDendron finds the **usable center** between the two extremes by supporting backlinks of any two arbitrary notes while also maintaining a **canonical hierarchy** for every note. We do this through our **[hierarchal first approach to note taking](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html)** that relies on the combination of [[hierarchies|dendron.topic.hierarchies]], [[schemas|dendron.topic.schema]], and [[path based lookups| dendron.topic.lookup]]. \n\nWith Dendron, you can **create, find, and collaborate** on information that **matters to you**.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/graph-intro.gif)\n\n\n## Use Cases\n\nWhether you organize your notes with [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) or [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/), link notes together like [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), or simply create notes in an ad-hoc manner, Dendron can help.\n\nThink of it as a [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) to help you **make sense** of all the information you care about.\n\nSome popular use cases include:\n\n- project management \n- learning & academia\n- personal knowledge base \n- journaling of all forms\n- CRM to keep track of clients, friends and enemies\n- {Your Use Case Here}\n\n## Getting Started\n\n((ref:[[dendron.guides.install]]#Getting Started,1:#Install))\n\n## Onboarding\n\n[Kevin](https://kevinslin.com/), the founder of Dendron, does a personal onboarding with new users.

Dendron is the greek word for tree. It's a reference to the hierarchal note taking that Dendron(3) enables. \n2. Dendron is another word for [dendrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) which is an extension of the nerve cell that sends and receives signals in the brain. Think of Dendron(3) as a digital nervous system that helps you consolidate all the information that you care about in the fastest and most efficient way possible.\n3. Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you build, organize, and share knowledge bases of any size.\n\n## How do I get started?\n\n1. Launch the _command bar_ inside vscode:\n    - Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n    - macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`\n    - Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n2. Paste the following command and press `Enter`:\n\n```bash\n> Dendron: Initialize Workspace\n```\n\n![Initialize workspace](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/dendron-init.gif)\n\nWhen the workspace opens, it will show dialogue to install the recommended extensions.

They live in your file system and are completely portable across any platform. \n\nThe `---` section at the top is [[frontmatter|dendron.concepts#frontmatter]]. Frontmatter are custom attributes at the top of each markdown file. Dendron uses it to store metadata about each note and is used for features like [[publishing|dendron.topic.publishing]]. You can also add your own custom data to the frontmatter. \n\n### Creating a hierarchy\n\nTo create a hierarchy, bring up lookup again. Note that it will be pre-filled with the name of the current note. \n\nEnter ➡️ to move the cursor to the end, type `.world`, and then press enter. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.hello-world.jpg)\n\nYou have now created your first [[hierarchy|dendron.concepts#hierarchies]].\n\nHierarchy in dendron are just `.` delimited files. You can open the tree view (exhibit 1) to see the hierarchy more directly. You can see how the note looks on disk in the explorer view (exhibit 2).\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.tree-view.jpg)\n\nDendron uses (flexible) hierarchies to help you organize your notes. It's how people are able to manage tens of thousands of notes inside Dendron. This will become more clear as we go through this tutorial.\n\nNote that you can create a hierarchy at any level without friction. For example, type the following into lookup and hit enter: `lets.go.deep`\n\nYou'll notice in the tree view that there is now a `+` sign next to `lets` and `go`. The plus sign indicates that this note is a [[stub|dendron.concepts#stubs]]. A stub is a placeholder for a note that hasn't actually been created. Dendron uses stubs to avoid cluttering your file system with empty notes when creating hierarchies. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.deep.jpg)\n\n### Finding Notes\n\nTo find notes, we use the same lookup interface that we used to create them. Type the path of the note that you want to find them. Note that lookup uses fuzzy search which means you can type out partial results and still see the results. In practice, you'll only need to type a couple of characters to find any note stored inside Dendron.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.lookup-fuzzy.jpg)\n\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/784b8d5e-58eb-4e3e-98b0-8ed1690abc74.html","relUrl":"notes/784b8d5e-58eb-4e3e-98b0-8ed1690abc74.html"},{"doc":"Working with Links","title":"Working with Links","hpath":"dendron.tutorial.links","content":"\n## Working with Links\n\n### Creating a link\n\nCreate a new note using lookup called `onboarding`.

Dendron will auto-complete with a matching set of closing brackets `]]` as well as give you a list of completions of existing notes.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.completion.jpg)\n\nWe are going to create a new note instead of linking to an existing note. So type `pro.skynet` as your link. `pro` is short of `project` in this case. \n\n```\nRead up on [[pro.skynet]]\n```\n\n### Creating a note (with a link)\n\nWith your cursor somewhere inside `[[pro.skynet]]`, hit `F12`. This will create the `pro.skynet` note. Just like with lookup, Dendron automatically creates notes to links that don't exist when you navigate to them. \n\nYou can switch back to the previous note by pressing `CTRL-Tab`\n\n### Adding a link alias\n\nYou can add an alternative title to the link by creating an alias. For example, add `the project|` to your link to change the name in the preview, (If you've closed your preview, you can open it using `CMD+SHIFT+P` or `WINDOWS+SHIFT+P`).\n\n```\nRead up on [[the project|pro.skynet]]\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.alias.jpg)\n\n### Navigating links\n\nTo go back to the previous page, you can either use `CTRL-TAB`, hit `F12` over the link, click the link on the preview, or click the link inside the note while holding down the `option` or `ctrl` key (operating system dependent). You have lots of ways to navigate links in Dendron. \n\n### Backlinks\n\nWhen your back on `pro.skynet`, open the backlinks panel on the bottom left section of your sidebar. The backlinks panel shows you all notes with links that point to the current note. This is useful for helping to establish context.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.backlinks.jpg)\n\n### Note References\n\nCreate `[[pro.skynet.principals]]` inside `pro.skynet` and navigate to it by using `F12`. In this new note, write the principles for skynet. \n\n```\n1. Help humans do more\n2. Be nice to humans\n3. Don't overthrow humanity\n```\n\nWhile its nice to have principals in its own section, it's something you might want to include in the main project note. To embed a note into another note, Dendron uses [[note references|dendron.topic.refs]]. You can create a note reference by using `CMD|CTRL+SHIFT+R` while inside a note. Go ahead and do that now and use `CTRL-TAB` to switch back to `pro.skynet`. Now paste the reference. You should have a screen like the one below.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.refs.jpg)\n\nAt this point, you can delete your original link (`[[pro.skynet.principal]]`)\n\n### Note References (continued)\n\nNote references are extremely powerful and help you re-use your notes in a variety of places. To demonstrate, go back to the `pro.skynet.principals` and make the following modifications to the text.\n\n```\n## Help humans do more\n\nSkynet should help humans be the best human they can be. Skynet will do this using ultrasophisticated AI to help humans realize their true potential.\n\n## Be nice to humans\n\nSkynet should know that humans are delicate organic lifeforms and treat them as such. Skynet should not hurt their fragile egos or make humans feel bad.\n\n## Don't overthrow humanity\n\nSkynet should not launch nuclear missles or send robots from the future to come back to the past and wipe out humanity. \n```\n\nNow highlight the first header and use `CMD|CTRL+SHIFT+R` to create another note reference.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.refs-2-copy.jpg)\n\nGo back to `pro.skynet` and add paste your newly created reference. You should end up with the following screen. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.refs-2-copy-res.jpg)\n\nA few things to note here\n- notice how the original reference updated with the text of the note. \n- notice that the newly created reference only has the contents from the newly created header\n- notice that the newly created reference doesn't show the actual header itself (you can change this behavior by removing the `,1` inside the reference)\n\nNote references are incredibly powerful. You can do additional things like enter a range of headers to do a reference of, include a reference within a reference, and even reference multiple pages using a wildcard pattern. You can see detailed examples of all these functions in the [[docs|dendron.topic.refs]].\n\n### Relative Links\n\nSometimes, you don't want to embed a note but just link to a particular section of a given note. You can do that with Dendron relative links. The syntax to do so is `[[{link-name}#{link-header}]]`. Dendron will create a relative link automatically if you select the header and use `CMD|CTRL+SHIFT+C` to create a link (if you don't have a header selected, Dendron will create a regular link to the whole page). When you navigate to a regular link, Dendron will scroll to that specific section of the page.\n\n- NOTE: relative links are currently not supported in the preview\n\n### Link Previews\n\nSomething to point out is that you can preview a link by using your mouse to hover over it. This even works for note references. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.links-preview.jpg)\n\n### Non-Markdown Links\n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.links]]#other links,1))\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/d758fe38-558c-4f20-a091-cac146a781cb.html","relUrl":"notes/d758fe38-558c-4f20-a091-cac146a781cb.html"},{"doc":"Topics","title":"Topics","hpath":"dendron.topic","content":"\n# Topics\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/7a7af2fa-b9d0-4adc-81e6-f03186123539.html","relUrl":"notes/7a7af2fa-b9d0-4adc-81e6-f03186123539.html"},{"doc":"Workbench","title":"Workbench","hpath":"dendron.topic.workbench","content":"\n\n# Workbench\n\nThe Dendron workbench is the overall UI that surrounds the editor.

The `id` field of the schema is used to build a [glob pattern](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/) which will be used to match notes matching the schema.\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nschemas:\n# this will match \"cli.*\" notes\n- id: cli \n  # human readable description of hierarchy\n  desc: command line interface reference\n  # add this to the domain of your schema hierarchy\n  parent: root\n  # when a schema is a namespace, it can have arbitrary children. equivalent to cli.* glob pattern\n  namespace: true \n  children:\n    - cmd\n    - env\n# will match cli.*.env\n- id: env\n  desc: cli specific env variables\n# will match cli.*.cmd.*\n- id: cmd\n  desc: subcommands \n  namespace: true\n```\n\nBelow is another way of representing the above schema\n```\n.\n└── cli # matches cli\n    └── {cli child} # matches cli.*\n        ├── env # matches cli.*.env\n        └── cmd # matches cli.*.cmd\n            └── {cmd child} # matches cli.*.cmd.*\n```\n\n## Schema Properties\n\n### version (optional): number\n- values: `0|1`\n- default: 0\n- description: schema version number\n\n### imports (optional): str[]\n- values: list of schemas to import\n- default: []\n- description: import schemas from another schema into the current schema\n  - when using schemas from an external schema file, you will need to prefix the schema with the file name without the `schema.yml` suffix\n- NOTE: `import` is only available in schema version `1`\n\nExample:\n\n- foo.schema. yml\n```yml\nversion: 1\nimports:\n- bar\nschemas:\n- id: foo\n  parent: root\n  children:\n    - bar.bar # notice that we prefix the id bar with the filename\n```\n\n- bar.schema.yml\n```yml\nversion: 1\nschemas:\n- id: bar\n  parent: root\n  children: \n    - one\n- id: one\n```\n\nThe above would match the following files\n\n```\nfoo.bar # match\nfoo.bar.one #match\n```\n\n### schemas\n- list of schema entities\n\n#### id\n\nthe identifier of the schema. also designates the glob pattern match. this is the **only** required part of a schema. all other fields are optional\n\n#### desc\nhuman readable description of the schema node. these will automatically when creating notes that match the schema.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-desc.gif)\n\n#### parent\n- only required for schema [domain](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html#domain)\n- NOTE: at least one schema MUST have `parent: root` set \n\n#### namespace\n\nmaking a schema node a namespace automatically brings its immediate children as part of the schema, even if they are not explicitly defined in the schema definition. it will also automatically set the pattern to `{namespace}.*`\n\n- example:\n```yml\nschemas:\n- id: project\n  parent: root\n  namespace: true\n```\n\n- this will match: \n  - `project`\n  - `project.foo`\n  - `project.bar`\n- it will not match\n  - `project.foo.bar`\n\n#### pattern\n\nglob pattern that schema matches. by default, this is the `id` of the schema. you can override this. \n\nFor example, take a look at the journal schema below\n```yml\nschemas:\n- id: journal\n  title: journal\n  desc: \"\"\n  parent: root\n  children:\n    - year\n- id: year\n  title: year\n  pattern: \"[0-2][0-9][0-9][0-9]\"\n  children: \n    - month\n- id: month\n  title: month\n  pattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\n  children: \n    - day\n- id: day\n  title: day\n  pattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\n  namespace: true\n```\n\nThis will match the following queries\n```\n# journal\n# journal.2020\n# journal.2020.09\n# journal.2020.09.12\n# journal.2020.09.12.foo.md\n```\n\n#### children\n\nlist of ids of schemas that are the child of the current schema\n\n#### template\na template you can apply to all notes that match this schema. See **Schema Templates** for more details.\n```yml\ntemplate:\n  # identifier for the template (for a note based template, it would be the name of the note)\n  id: journal.template.daily\n  # what sort of template we are creating. currently, only 'note' is supported\n  type: note\n\n```\n\n## Schema Templates\n\nSchema templates let you designate a note as a **template**. Newly created notes that match a schema with a template will have both the contents and custom frontmatter of the template note applied at creation.\n\nThis is extremely useful whenever you want to re-use the outline of a note. Examples include daily journals, weekly shopping lists, and weekly reviews.  \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755-with-play.gif\"> \n</a>\n\n## Unknown Schema\n\nDendron doesn't force you to use schemas if you don't want to. This is why you can create notes that don't match any schema. Dendron will show you a `?` next to these results.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-question.jpg)\n\n> Sometimes ~~rules~~ schemas are meant to be broken\n\n## Working with Schemas\n\nSchemas can be modified, created and deleted using the same lookup interface that you use for regular notes. See [[lookup | dendron.topic.lookup]] for further details about working with schemas.\n\n## Example Schemas\n\n- [Project and Journal](https://gist.github.com/kevinslin/5ca7a6f25a239add5ea374f329e6a19e)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Error with parsing some schemas during initialization\n\nIf you get this error, it means that Dendron encountered some malformed schemas during initialization. You can open the error message to see what schemas are affected.\n\nCommon errors:\n- the YAML isn't valid (use http://www.yamllint.com/ to validate)\n- there is no schema with `parent: root` property \n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.schema]]#parent:#*))\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html","relUrl":"notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html"},{"doc":"References","title":"References","hpath":"dendron.topic.refs","content":"\n# References \n\nDendron allows you to reference content from other notes and embed them in your current note.\n\nCurrently, Dendron supports 3 types of references:\n\n- note references\n- block references\n- block range references\n\nReferences have the following syntax\n\n```\n((\n    ref: [[ NAME_OF_NOTE ]]                     # name of note, required\n    #STARTING_HEADER                            # optional\n    :#ENDING_HEADER                             # optional\n))\n```\n\n\n- NOTE: Dendron has a `Copy Note Ref` command that will copy the reference of the current note.\n\n\n## Configuration\n- note references by default come with an outline. you can set the following to `false` in the settings to disable this behavior\n\n```\n\"markdown-preview-enhanced.renderRefWithOutline\": true\n```\n\n## Commands\n\nYou can create a ref either by hand or using the `Copy Note Ref` command.\n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.commands]]#copy note ref:#*))\n\n## Note Reference\n\nA note reference will include the entire contents of a note within another note. Below is an example of a note reference.\n\n```\n((ref: [[dendron.demo.refs.sample]]))\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/refs.block.gif)\n\nNote that references also respect the wildcard operator. The following example will include all child pages of sample. \n\n```\n((ref: [[dendron.demo.refs.sample.*]]))\n```\n\n## Block Reference\nA block reference will include the entire contents of a note starting from a specified heading. \n\n```\n((ref:[[demo.embed.block]]#head1))\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/ref-block.gif)\n\n## Block Range Reference\nA block range reference will include the contents of a note starting from a `start` header and ending at a `end` header. \n\n```\n((ref:[[demo.embed.block]]#head1:#head3))\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/ref-block-range.gif)\n\n## Note Reference Offset\n\nA note reference offset is a way to skip a number of lines when using a note reference. The syntax is `,{number}`. Below is an example of using a note reference offset to offset an initial heading, skipping the actual header when doing the embeding.\n- NOTE: currently, note reference offsets are limited to the first anchor inside a block reference. They must also be a positive value\n\n```\n((ref:[[demo.embed.block]]#head1,1))\n```\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/31cb62916586453f8475f94ba68b74a1\">  <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/31cb62916586453f8475f94ba68b74a1-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n## Wildcard Header Reference\n\nWhen you're referencing a header by reference, sometimes you don't care what the next header is, just that the reference covers all text up to the next header. You can now specify this using the `*` symbol in a header reference.\n\nFor example, the following would reference the content from header1 to the next header. \n\n```\n((ref:[[demo.embed.block]]#head1:#*))\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/refs.wildcard.gif)\n\n## Recursive Reference\n\nNote references can refer to notes with references inside. Dendron current supports references two levels deep. This applies to both the **local preview** as well as **publishing**.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/refs.recursion.jpg)\n\n## Wildcard Note Refs\n\n[[Note references|dendron.topic.refs]] accept the `*` operator at the end which lets you grab all notes of a given level of hierarchy. This also works with typical note reference operation like block selection which means you can use it to grab specific blocks from every note in a level.\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/9401e5dfe60f4f589e14d50e280d11f5\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c.html","relUrl":"notes/f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c.html"},{"doc":"Publishing v2","title":"Publishing v2","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishingv2","content":"\n# Publishing V2 (Preview)\n\nDendron lets you publish the contents of your vault, either in its entirety or only a subset.

It is meant to help you create, organize, and collaborate on knowledge bases of any size.\"\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\n```\n\n## Note Configuration\n\nYou can specify how notes are published via the frontmatter of each note. \n\n### published\n- default: true\n\nTo exclude a page from publication, you can add the following to the frontmatter. If you set `publishByDefault: false` for a hierarchy, this needs to be set to `true` to publish\n\n```yml\n...\npublished: false\n```\n\n### nav_exclude\n\nIf set, do not include the current note in the navigation bar. \n\n### nav_order\n- type: number\n\nIf set, denote order that item appears in the published nav bar\n\n### noindex\n- default: false\n\nTo tell google to not index a page, you can add the following tag to the frontmatter. You can also have this as a default for a given hierarchy by setting `noIndexByDefault: true` in the site config.\n\n```yml\n...\nnoindex: true\n```\n\n### collection options\n\n[[Collection specific|dendron.topic.publishingv2.collections]] options. \n\n#### date \n\nIf set, used to designate a custom publication date. By default, use timestamp of `created` field. \n\n#### has_collection\n- default: false\n\nWhether a given page is a collection\n\n#### skipLevels\n\nIf set, determines how many levels of children to skip when making the collection. For example, you might have the following hierarchy. \n\n```\n- blog.md\n- blog.reading.md\n- blog.reading.journal.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.20.one.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.31.two.md\n```\n\nWhen you publish, you might only want to show the leaf nodes and skip the intermediary levels. In the above example, setting `skipLevels: 3` on `blog.reading.md` will result in the following hierarchy being published.\n\n```\n- blog.md\n- blog.reading.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.20.one.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.31.two.md\n```\n\n#### sort_order\n- default: normal\n\nSort items in a collection page. Ascending by default. Specify `reverse` to sort in descending order.\n\n\n## Line Configuration\n\nYou can control publication on a per line basis.\n\n### LOCAL_ONLY_LINE\n\n`\n\n```markdown\nHello World!  <!-- Will be published -->\n\n <!-- won't be published -->\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/pod-local.gif)\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/f2ed8639-a604-4a9d-b76c-41e205fb8713.html","relUrl":"notes/f2ed8639-a604-4a9d-b76c-41e205fb8713.html"},{"doc":"Collections","title":"Collections","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishingv2.collections","content":"\n# Collections \n\nSometimes, you might want to publish a page that has all its children listed like in a blog archive format. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publishv2.collection.jpg)\n\nThis format is called a `collection` in Dendron.

Depending on what notes you want to publish, you will want to update your `dendron.yml` file. By default, everything will be published\n1. Update the contents of `_config.yml` inside your `docs` folder to specify site wide configuration like logo and title.\n    - NOTE: this is located relative to `dendron.rootDir`\n    - if you do not have a `docs` folder, you can run `Dev:Dendron: Doctor` to create one\n2. When you are ready to publish, run the `> Dendron: Build Pod` command to prepare your site for publication. This builds your notes into the `siteRootDir` directory which defaults to `docs`. `Build Pod` does the following when it builds your site:\n    - copies over the notes specified in `dendron.yml`\n    - creates a copy of your notes with the ids in place of the file names \n    - updates all `wiki-links` to `markdown-links` so Jekyll can process it, preserving titles if there are any\n3. Commit your changes.\n4. Push your repository using `> Git: Push`\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOZJxKg0-js\">![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/dendron-publishing.jpg)</a>\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/c800d576-789c-4a68-ac03-a66efd40d39b.html","relUrl":"notes/c800d576-789c-4a68-ac03-a66efd40d39b.html"},{"doc":"Local Preview","title":"Local Preview","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing.local-preview","content":"\n# Local Preview\n\n> The following guide was created by fellow Dendronite [Ed](https://github.com/ens100)! \n\nIn order to publish your notes, we have included a brief step by step guide to get you started. \n\nIn a nutshell, we need to:\n- Install Ruby \n- Install Jekyll\n- Set up the environment\n- Publish our notes\n- Enjoy the fruits of our labor\n\nAlthough these may seem complex, I hope the following guide will assist and make things as simple as possible.\n\n## Installing Ruby\n\nRuby version 2.5.0 or higher is needed, so open a Terminal window (eg. PowerShell / cmd) and type `ruby -v`. If the error message \"_ruby : The term 'ruby' is not recognized_\" comes up do the following:\n \n- Navigate [here](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and download the recommended **Ruby+Devkit** and then open the downloaded file.\n- When the installation is complete you will see an option to Run `ridk install`. Make sure this is checked as it is needed for installing Jekyll and click finish.\n- A terminal window will open asking what components to install - Simply press the `enter` key to install the default components.\n- Close the terminal and reopen a new iteration to ensure that the Path variables have been set.\n- In the newly opened Terminal run `ruby -v` and you should get `ruby 2.6.6p146 (2020-03-31 revision 67876) [x64-mingw32]` or similar back.\n\n## Installing Jekyll\n\n- From the Terminal type `gem install jekyll bundler` and let it run until finished (takes a few minutes).\n- When completed run `jekyll -v` and the Terminal should return with something like: `jekyll 4.1.1`.\n\nStep 1 and 2 over and done with.\n\n## Setting up the Environment\n\n- In the Terminal navigate to the `docs` folder within your dendron vault.\n    - The easiest way to do this is to copy the location of the folder in File Explorer and then go to the Terminal and type `cd ` and paste the copied text and then click enter. \n- Run `bundle install`\n\nWe are approaching the finishing line.\n\n## Publishing Our Notes\n\nIn order for our notes / markdown files to be published we need to carry out the following steps:\n\n- From within Dendron, run the \"Build Pod\" command by clicking `ctrl + Shift + P` and typing Pod. This will bring up the option `> Dendron: Build Pod`, select it and click enter.\n- In the bottom right hand side after a few seconds you should see \"finished\".\n\n\n## Last Step\n\n- Open the terminal and type `bundle exec jekyll serve` \n- This will run a configuration to generate the markdown files to static pages so that they can be viewed online. \n- Once the above step is completed, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`. \n- You should see a copy of your notes using a similar theme as this one.\n\nYou will be able to see any changes you do to your notes in Dendron on the localhost. \n\nThink this deserves a high five! \n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/63b184f7-1901-4580-af40-97ef87069a04.html","relUrl":"notes/63b184f7-1901-4580-af40-97ef87069a04.html"},{"doc":"Features","title":"Features","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing.features","content":"\n# Features\n\n### Nested Hierarchies\n\nPublishing supports the same nested hierarchies as your notes and allows you to navigate via the sidebar.\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-hierarchy.gif\" />\n\n### Nav Based Hierarchy Hints\n\nYou can see at a glance which notes have children and explore them from the nav without refreshing the page. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/dendron.jekyll.gif)\n\n### Edit on Github\n\nEvery page can accept one-click contributions as long as the contributor has a github account. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/jekyll.edit.jpg)\n\n\nExample of making a contribution to Dendron. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/4a1b67f3fd1a40dab16949e9ea5e53dc\"> <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/4a1b67f3fd1a40dab16949e9ea5e53dc-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n\n### Lookup\n\nIf you'd rather not click, dendron-jekyll also supports path based lookup.\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-lookup.gif\" />\n\n### Permanent Ids\n\nEvery page is published using its unique ID which means that urls will never change, even if the filenames do.\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-ids.jpg\" />\n\n\nIf you have a free github account, then you can host your Dendron notes for free using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) \n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-domain.jpg\" />\n\n### Jekyll Liquid Tags and Variables \n\nYou can find the docs on this under [[liquid| dendron.topic.liquid]]\n- NOTE: this will only be \"compiled\" in the published site but won't be rendered in the regular markdown \n\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-liquid.gif\" />\n\n### Selective Publication\n\nYou can choose to publish your whole vault, a single domain, or multiple domains within your vault.\n\n### Note References\n\nDendron has [[note references|dendron.topic.refs]] that let you inline either the whole note or parts of a note into another note.

Tools like Evernote and Roam are pods. Social media services like Twitter and Facebook are pods. Publication destinations like static sites and Medium are pods. Everything is a pod.\n\nPods let you do the following:\n- **import** your notes from any existing location into Dendron\n- **export** your notes from Dendron to any existing location\n- **publish** your notes from Dendron to any existing location\n\nTo access pods, Dendron exposes three commands:\n- `Dendron: Import Pod`: imports notes \n- `Dendron: Export Pod`: export notes \n- `Dendron: Publish Pod`: publish notes \n\n**NOTE**: not all pods will expose all three commands. Each pod implementation can choose to implement any subset of the three commands. \n\n## Pod Methods\n\n### Import\n\nImporting lets you bulk import notes from a given source and into Dendron. The notes are formatted and converted to Dendron's hierarchal structure.\n\n### Export\n\nExporting lets you bulk export notes from Dendron into another destinations. The notes will be formatted and converted to the native format of the destination. \n\n### Publish\n\nPublishing lets you take one note and output it into a different format/destination. \n\nFor example, you might want to use our [[markdown pod|dendron.topic.pod.markdown]] to take a note with [[note references|dendron.topic.refs]] and publish it as a regular markdown note to use in a github issue or another tool.\n\nFuture uses of the **publish** method will be taking a note and publishing it to social media (eg. twitter, facebook, linkedin), publishing it to Gmail, and publishing to destinations like Medium and dev.to.\n\n\n## Types of Pods\nThere are two types of pods:\n- builtin \n- custom\n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.pod.builtin]]#builtin pods:#*))\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.pod.custom]]#custom pods:#*))\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/66727a39-d0a7-449b-a10d-f6c438185d7f.html","relUrl":"notes/66727a39-d0a7-449b-a10d-f6c438185d7f.html"},{"doc":"Markdown","title":"Markdown","hpath":"dendron.topic.pod.markdown","content":"\n# Markdown \n\n- interface:\n    - Publish\n\n## Publish\n\nThe markdown pod lets you convert Dendron's custom markdown into regular markdown. \n\nCustom Dendron directives like note references will be converted and embedded as regular Markdown.\n\n\n### Configuration\n\n- wikiLinkBehavior:\n    - desc: how to convert wiki links\n    - required: no\n    - choices:\n        - convert2Text\n        - convert2Md\n    - default: convert2Md\n- wikiLinkHierarchyBehavior:\n    - desc: if we should change hierarchy \n    - required: no\n    - choices:\n        - copy\n        - useBasename\n    - default: copy\n- addAutogenWarning:\n    - desc: leave markdown comments about auto-generated content\n    - required: no\n    - default: false\n- dest:\n    - desc: where does the note go to\n    - choices:\n        - clipboard: system clipboard\n        - buffer: go into a new untitled window\n    - default: buffer\n\n### Example\n\n- note in Dendron\n```markdown\n---\nid: meet.journal.2020.10.17.publish\n\n---\n\n# People\n- [[people.joe-snail]]\n- [[people.kevin-lin]]\n\n# Notes\n- decide date to announce publish feature\n- ...\n\n# Resources\n((ref: [[pro.dendron.feat.publish]]))\n\n# Next\n- [ ] post announcement\n\n```\n\n- note after publishing \n\n```markdown\n\n# People\n- [people.joe-snail](people.joe-snail)\n- [people.kevin-lin](people.kevin-lin)\n\n# Notes\n- decide date to announce publish feature\n- ...\n\n# Resources\n\n## Publish \n...\n\n# Next\n- [ ] post announcement\n\n```\n- note after publishing with following options\n\n```yml\nwikiLinkBehavior: convert2Text\naddAutogenWarning: true\nwikiLinkHierarchyBehavior: useBasename\n```\n\n```markdown\n\n# People\n- joe-snail\n- kevin-lin\n\n# Notes\n- decide date to announce publish feature\n- ...\n\n# Resources\n<!-- THIS_IS_MACHINE_GENERATED, START -->\n## Publish \n...\n<!-- THIS_IS_MACHINE_GENERATED, STOP -->\n\n# Next\n- [ ] post announcement\n\n```\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Better way of dealing with links. When publishing a single note, any wiki-links will presumably not work after publication. Do we want a `recursive` publish option to also resolve any wiki links and publish a whole bunch of files at once?\n\n2. Nicer ways of rendering a note reference. Currently, Dendron's note references come with the **title** and **link** of the original text. We use custom css to style the outline. When publishing, we can't assume the presence of that css. How would a **renderOutline** option look like?\n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.refs]]#references,1:#*))\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/727b1087-191a-4bef-a6d0-8c9ae190426d.html","relUrl":"notes/727b1087-191a-4bef-a6d0-8c9ae190426d.html"},{"doc":"Custom","title":"Custom","hpath":"dendron.topic.pod.custom","content":"# Custom Pods\n- STATUS: DRAFT\n-  NOTE: this documentation is for future functionality.

Each vault is a folder that can contain any number of hierarchies. \n\n## Use Cases\n- for **sensitive notes**, multi-vault enables local only vaults vs vaults that can are synced on file sharing services like dropbox \n- for **modularizing knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to mix and match existing vaults depending on context\n- for **federating and curating knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to publish/subscribe to public vaults using protocols like `git`\n- for **access control**, multi-vault lets users configure specific vaults to be **private** which turns off publication and sharing of any notes inside said vault\n\n## Quickstart\n\n\nDocumentation for lookup is still being written. For *up to date* docs, see the [[multi vault project page|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]].\n\n## Topics\n\n### Commands\n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.commands]]#vault add:#*))\n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.commands]]#vault remove:#*))\n\n### Lookup\n\nLookup supports multiple vaults. When using lookup to find a note, each search result is labeled with which vault it belongs to. \n\nWhen creating a note in lookup, the currently opened note's vault is used as the vault for the new note.\n\n#### Specify Vault Location when Creating a Note\n\nWith this set, you can pick the vault for new notes.  To enable,  add `lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true` in the dendron configuration. Instructions to do so below.\n\n1. > Dendron: Configure (yaml)\n2. add `lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true` so your configuration looks like the following:\n```yml\nversion: 0\n...\nlookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true\n```\n\n### Publishing\n\nYou can publish from a multi-vault enabled workspace if you are using [[dendron-11ty|dendron.pro.dendron-11ty]] to publish. \n\nWe have added a new configuration, `duplicateNoteBehavior`, which [[controls|dendron.topic.publishingv2.configuration#duplicatenotebehavior-optional]] how Dendron handles duplicate notes across multiple vaults. \n\n### Note References\n\n[[Note references|dendron.topic.refs]] are vault specific. When you make a reference, Dendron will include the note from the same note.

You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.\n\n## Syntax guide\n\n### Headers\n\n```markdown\n# This is an <h1> tag\n\n## This is an <h2> tag\n\n### This is an <h3> tag\n\n#### This is an <h4> tag\n\n##### This is an <h5> tag\n\n###### This is an <h6> tag\n```\n\nIf you want to add `id` and `class` to the header, then simply append `{#id .class1 .class2}`. For example:\n\n```markdown\n# This heading has 1 id {#my_id}\n\n# This heading has 2 classes {.class1 .class2}\n```\n\n> This is a MPE extended feature.\n\n### Emphasis\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```markdown\n*This text will be italic*\n_This will also be italic_\n\n**This text will be bold**\n__This will also be bold__\n\n_You **can** combine them_\n\n~~This text will be strikethrough~~\n```\n\n### Lists\n\n#### Unordered List\n\n```markdown\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n  - Item 2a\n  - Item 2b\n```\n\n#### Ordered List\n\n```markdown\n1. Item 1\n1. Item 2\n1. Item 3\n   1. Item 3a\n   1. Item 3b\n```\n\n#### Definition List\n\n```markdown\nItem 1\n: Definition for Item 1\n\nItem 2\n~ Definition for Item 2\n~ Another definition for Item 2, with a [link](http://www.example.com)\n```\n\n### Images\n\n```markdown\n![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)\nFormat: ![Alt Text](url)\n```\n\n### Links\n\n```markdown\nhttps://github.com - automatic!\n[GitHub](https://github.com)\n```\n\n### Blockquote\n\n```markdown\nAs Kanye West said:\n\n> We're living the future so\n> the present is our past.\n```\n\n### Horizontal Rule\n\n```markdown\nThree or more...\n\n---\n\nHyphens\n\n---\n\nAsterisks\n\n---\n\nUnderscores\n```\n\n### Inline code\n\n```markdown\nI think you should use an\n`<addr>` element here instead.\n```\n\n### Fenced code block\n\nYou can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks <code>\\`\\`\\`</code> before and after the code block.\n\n#### Syntax Highlighting\n\nYou can add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting in your fenced code block.\n\nFor example, to syntax highlight Ruby code:\n\n    ```ruby\n    require 'redcarpet'\n    markdown = Redcarpet.new(\"Hello World!\")\n    puts markdown.to_html\n    ```\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'redcarpet'\nmarkdown = Redcarpet.new(\"Hello World!\")\nputs markdown.to_html\n```\n### Task lists\n\n```markdown\n- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)\n- [x] this is a complete item\n- [ ] this is an incomplete item\n```\n\n### Tables\n\nYou can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```markdown\nFirst Header | Second Header\n------------ | -------------\nContent from cell 1 | Content from cell 2\nContent in the first column | Content in the second column\n```\n\nYou can create a table from existing content using `> Markdown Shortcuts: Add Table` command.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdickin/vscode-markdown-shortcuts/master/media/demo/table_with_header.gif)\n\n### Abbreviation\n\n\nThe HTML specification\n\n```markdown\n_[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language\n_[W3C]: World Wide Web Consortium\nThe HTML specification\nis maintained by the W3C.\n```\n<!-- \n## Extended syntax\n\n### Table\n\n> Need to enable `enableExtendedTableSyntax` in extension settings to get it work.\n\n![screen shot 2017-07-15 at 8 16 45 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1908863/28243710-945e3004-699a-11e7-9a5f-d74f6c944c3b.png)\n\n### Emoji & Font-Awesome\n\n> This only works for `markdown-it parser` but not `pandoc parser`.  \n> Enabled by default.

That being said, many of the features we have (eg. block based note references) have no common mark equivalent which is why we've had to invent new syntax.\n\nYou can use the [[markdown pod|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.markdown]] to migrate both individual notes and your entire vault to a CommonMark compatible format.\n\n## Other Resources\n\n- [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)\n- [Daring Fireball: Markdown Basics](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)\n- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)\n\n## References\n\nThe content of this page is derived from the following sources:\n\n1.

To lookup a schema, use `> Dendron: Lookup Schema` or the `Cmd+Shift+L` (`Ctrl+Shift+L` on windows and linux) shortcut to bring up the schema lookup.\n\n### Finding Schemas\n\nThe process for finding schemas using Dendron is the same as that for finding notes. One lookup to rule them all. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-lookup.gif)\n\n### Creating Schemas\n\nJust like with notes, if you enter the name of a schema that does not exist, Dendron will create it for you.\n\nSpecifically, Dendron will create `{value}.schema.yml` in your vault. At this point, you are free to edit the schema. After you're satisfied with the result, you'll need to run [[> Dendron: Reload Index| dendron.topic.commands]] for it to take affect. \n\n- NOTE: if you get an error after running `Reload Index`, it is most likely because your YAML is malformed. You can paste it in [yaml lint](http://www.yamllint.com/) to check that you are using the correct yaml syntax. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-create.gif)\n\n### Deleting Schemas\n\nThe process for deleting schemas using Dendron is identical to deleting notes.\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/60c03500-98e4-4a02-a31e-2702b4068a88.html","relUrl":"notes/60c03500-98e4-4a02-a31e-2702b4068a88.html"},{"doc":"Modifiers","title":"Modifiers","hpath":"dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers","content":"\n# Modifiers\n\nModifiers allow you to update the behavior of lookup.

This is the `root.md`. \n\n### Domain\n\nThe domain is the root of a specific hierarchy. In our example vault, we have one domain - `dendron`.\n\n\n## Why Hierarchies?\n\nDendron is built around hierarchies and the axiom that a canonical hierarichal representation of notes is one of the most effective ways of managing large numbers of notes. You can read more about the thoughts behind this [here](https://kevinslin.com/organizing/its_not_you_its_your_knowledge_base/).\n\n## What's with the `.`'s?\n\n\n1. It allows each **file** to also be a **folder**. This means your notes can have data but also contain other notes. \n1. It makes it much easier to perform certain refactoring operations. For example, say you had the following [[schema |dendron.topic.schema]]\n    ```yml\n    - id: a-parent\n    children:\n        - child-a\n        - child-b\n    - id: child-a\n    - id: child-b\n    ```\n   Lets say you wanted to make `child-b` a child of `child-a`\n    ```yml\n    - id: a-parent\n    children:\n        - child-a\n    - id: child-a\n    children:\n        - child-b\n    - id: child-b\n    ```\n    With the classical folder hierarchy, you would need to turn `child-a` into a folder and then create a custom file to hold the content from the original `child-a`\n    ```\n    .\n    └── a-parent\n        └── child-a\n            ├── child-a-note\n            └── child-b\n    ```\n    With the `.` delimited hierarchy, this becomes a simple rename operation\n    ```\n    .\n    ├── a-parent.child-a\n    └── a-parent.child-a.child-b\n    ```\n1. It allows us to create [[stubs | dendron.topic.schema ]] for parts of the hierarchy that don't exist and not clutter our file system with empty folders. With the classical folder hierarchy\n    ```\n    .\n    └── a-parent\n        └── child-a\n            └── grandchild-a\n                └── great-grandchild-a.md\n    ```\n    With the `.` delimited hierarchy\n    ```\n    .\n    └── a-parent.child-a.grandchild-a.great-grandchild-a.md\n    ```\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/f3a41725-c5e5-4851-a6ed-5f541054d409.html","relUrl":"notes/f3a41725-c5e5-4851-a6ed-5f541054d409.html"},{"doc":"Graph View","title":"Graph View","hpath":"dendron.topic.graph-view","content":"\n#  Graph View\n\nDendron provides support for graph view using a fork of the [markdown-links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tchayen.markdown-links) extension. \n\nThe Dendron graph view is generated using our hierarchical index.

You will need to either change your `replacer` or move the affected files before Dendron will perform a refactor\n\nRefactor Hierarchy is \nhttps://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/743194856788328497/743195382795993291 \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/11d90a86fd1348a5a504406b52d79f85\"> <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/11d90a86fd1348a5a504406b52d79f85-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Go Up\n- shortcuts: \n  - mac: `cmd+shift+up`\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+up`\n  - when: `editorFocus`\n\n\nGo to closet non-stub parent of the currently open note\n\n\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/hierarchy.go-up.gif)\n\n### Go Next Sibling\n- shortcuts: \n  - key: `ctrl+shift+]`\n  - when: `editorFocus`\n\n\nGo to the next sibling\n\n\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/hierarchy.go-sibling.gif)\n\n### Go Previous Sibling\n- shortcuts: \n  - key: `ctrl+shift+[`\n  - when: `editorFocus`\n\n\nGo to the previous sibling\n\n\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/hierarchy.go-sibling.gif)\n\n### Go Down\n- shortcuts: \n  - mac: `cmd+shift+down`\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+down`\n  - when: `editorFocus`\n\n\nGo down the hierarchy\n\n\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/hierarchy.go-down.gif)\n\n---\n## Workspace\n### Vault Add\n- shortcuts: none\n\n\nAdd a new vault\n\n\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/b4171372f9794dd7be609c043f343fa3\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n### Vault Remove\n- shortcuts: none\n\n\nRemove a vault\n\n\n\nRemove a vault from your workspace.

I may have a few thousand more notes than @kevins8.\n> I've used apps - everything from Filemaker Pro, to Mark Bernstein's excellent Tinderbox, to DevonThink, to Tiddlywiki, to ones i've written myself, and dozens more, including the latest batch of 'tools for thought'. \n> Given my volume of notes over decades, I know a bit about the cul-de-sacs knowledge systems run into. I use new knowledge apps to see how they feel, but mostly studiously avoid getting stuck into complex systems and closed silos. I'm allergic to apps that are too limited for my volume and density of knowledge. I can't use Roam. I can almost use logseq. I can use dendron.\n> Kevin hid a copy of Vannevar Bush's 'As We May Think' in the dendron codebase. It's definitely true that the original vision of the hyperweb is back: something is changing today - a new level of literacy or a higher level of knowledge is emerging, and language, logic, and code are merging. This isn't the late 90's, no company is going to 'win'. Instead, a few pioneers are going to build a bridge to a new level  of thought for networked humanity.\n> Dendron stands apart from the pack.

Let's say I'd like to separate work and home into distinct vaults, maybe even so that other vault is a symbolic link to dropbox or whatever. Would that work? Also, what happens if there's a filename collision across vaults?\n\n## Jojo\n\nmulti-vault support is on the roadmap for this year. for naming collisions, i was thinking the following:\n- by default, surface all results with the vault name in the prefix\n\nsay a user has the following vaults\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    ├── kevin-vault\n    │   └── python.hello.md\n    └── jojo-vault\n        └── python.hello.md\n```\n\nuser enters the following lookup: `python.hello`\n\nthey should see the following result\n```\npython.hello - kevin vault\npython.hello - jojo vault\n```\n\nwe can also introduce a vault specific prefix (eg. {vault}/{path}) to un-ambiguously specify our result\n\nuser would type `kevin-vault/python.hello` to specify they want to access `kevin-vault`\n\n\n\"why don't we just show all matches for an unprefixed link\" - this would work inside vscode, but if the user just publishes the workspace with conflicting vaults, I guess the link must point to some single pre-selected place(?). Also, I think the intent behind the link is to point to a single location, so asking user to fix it would probably be reasonable.\nThere's probably all kind of complex scenarios that we could envision (e.g. what if the user would like to merge domains across vaults and show all merged notes in the published page as a merged web page?), but then again 99.9% of the real cases probably just want to use multiple folders and avoid conflicts. Showing errors would probably be the easiest and still sufficient solution.\n\n### Kevin\n\ncoming back to this thread. agree with your conclusion. the other solution would be to generate a popup/intermediary page for links with multiple destinations and let the user choose.\ne\nfor v1, would bias for what you suggested and error at build time. \n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/012b49e8-7638-4856-afc2-2db3c6406a86.html","relUrl":"notes/012b49e8-7638-4856-afc2-2db3c6406a86.html"},{"doc":"Entries","title":"Entries","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n","content":"\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/167bd57c-fb54-4a71-85b2-c26ba6df29fc.html","relUrl":"notes/167bd57c-fb54-4a71-85b2-c26ba6df29fc.html"},{"doc":"Backlog","title":"Backlog","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog","content":"\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/529fb02a-3ca9-4fbc-bcba-9435f8d13e89.html","relUrl":"notes/529fb02a-3ca9-4fbc-bcba-9435f8d13e89.html"},{"doc":"Org Mode","title":"Org Mode","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog.org-mode","content":"\n# Org Mode\n\n## Goals\n\nSupport org-mode sytnax within Dendron\n\n## Details\n\nThis project discusses how to best incorporate org-mode functionality into dendron\n\n## Proposals\n\n1. support {file}.org files\n2. support `org` syntax within `md` files\n\n\n### 1.

This can be implemented using the React Sortable Tree plugin, which will also be used for creating schemas.\n\n#### Organising the information connected to a node in a semantic and legible manner\n\nA standard graph view spreads the connected nodes arbitratily around the outside of a parent node. This is useful for understanding the general 'shape' of the connections between notes, but in order to understand the immediate connections between any particular note it is easier if they are arranged in a structured and comprehensible fashion. A view that visualises notes in a mindmap style format can achieve this.\n\n#### Activating mindmap view\n\nThe mindmap view can be triggered through the command palette as a Dendron command, as well as from an icon in the Activity Bar, or through the right-click context menu on a note. Launching it from the activity bar or command palette will launch it in the root of your vault, while launching it from the right click context menu on a note will open it focused to that particular note.\n\n#### Indication of related note\n\nWhen a note is opened from the mindmap view (or the mindmap view is opened from a note), it is linked so that navigating to other notes via the mindmap panel will open them in that same panel. This can be indicated by an icon in the menu bar of the linked panel, or an icon in the tab in the linked panel.\n\n#### Creation of new child notes by clicking\n\nA '+' icon on a note when clicked can add a child note underneath that note.\n\n#### Schema visualisation\n\nA mindmap-style visualisation lends itself to visualising the abstract concept of a schema. A note with a schema applied shows the potential nodes that it could have according to the schema as transparent notes with a '+' symbol, which when clicked will create that note.\n\n#### Expanding scope of mindmap focus\n\nThe mindmap view can also be expanded to show additional generations of notes from the same focused note (the grandparents and grandchildren of the focused note). There are '+' and '-' buttons in the mindmap view panel to increase or decrease the amount of visible generations.\n\n#### Configuration options\n\nTBD\n\n## Questions\n\n### What is the difference between this and Dendron's graph view?\n\nThe graph view shows an overview of your _entire knowledge base_ and can be traversed by scrolling and zooming. This can be useful for understand the general structure of all your notes, and the broad relationships between domains in your hierarchy but is less suited for focusing on a particular domain.\n\nThe mindmap view would allow users to focus their attention on a particular node, it's siblings, parents and children, view them in a visually organised manner, and traverse their notes by selecting notes directly attached to that domain. In this sense, it is more suited to giving you an overview of a particular _domain_.\n\n## Resources\n- [The Brain App](https://www.thebrain.com/)\n- [Discussion](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/739186036495876126/766252142549270550)\n- [React Sortable Tree](https://github.com/mikcaweb/react-sortable-tree)\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/533857a4-3dcb-478e-9877-5ab7f94ed6e6.html","relUrl":"notes/533857a4-3dcb-478e-9877-5ab7f94ed6e6.html"},{"doc":"Color Tabs","title":"Color Tabs","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog.color-tabs","content":"\n# Color Tabs\n\n- [github issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/261)\n\n## Goals\n\nSupport custom colorization of tabs in Dendron, specified by schema. \n\n## Details\nVSCode has the following settings for tabs. \n\n```\n\"workbench.colorCustomizations\": {\n    \"tab.activeBackground\": \"#FFFFFF\",\n    \"tab.activeForeground\":\"#000000\",\n    \"tab.inactiveForeground\":\"#FFFFFF\",\n    \"tab.inactiveBackground\":\"#000000\",\n    \"tab.border\":\"#FFFFFF\"\n}\n```\n\nThe properties that can be customized are `activeBackground` and `inactiveBackground`.

Note that the migration will involve standing up **two servers**: one for language server functionality (the lsp server), and another for dendron's [lookup](https://dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html) capabilities (the express server). \n\nThe rationale for having two servers is discussed [here](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/748936364283920495/759153642644701285).\n\nThey are also elaborated upon [here](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/735365126227493004/765435624878505985)\n\nInstead of calling the engine directly, the Dendron extension, as well as related plugins, will communicate to Dendron's server using IPC and on local ports. \n\n## Tasks\n- [x] add LSP server to Dendron (0.12)\n- [x] add api server to Dendron (0.12)\n- [x] hook server into dendron startup (0.12.4)\n- [x] migrate lookup to server model \n    - [x] support query notes (0.12.6)\n    - [x] support query notes with schema (0.12.6)\n    - [x] support write notes (0.12.6)\n    - [x] support write note with schema (0.12.6)\n    - [x] support delete note (0.12.7)\n    - [x] support query schema (0.12.7)\n    - [x] support write schema (0.12.7)\n    - [x] support delete schema  (0.12.7)\n- [x] optimize server lookup performance (0.12.7)\n- [x] enable file watcher (0.12.7)\n- [x] dendron tree view (0.12.7)\n- [x] migrate commands\n    - [x] scratch note (0.12.7)\n    - [x] journal note (0.12.7)\n    - [x] copy note command (0.12.7)\n    - [x] copy note url (0.12.7)\n    - [x] lookup scratch note (0.12.7)\n    - [x] lookup journal note (0.12.7)\n    - [x] global journal note (0.12.7)\n    - [x] build pod (0.12.8)\n    - [x] rename note\n    - [x] archive hierarchy\n    - [x] refactor hiearchy\n    - [x] doctor\n- [x] integration tests for all server functionality\n\n## Next\n- migrate bundled extensions to server model\n- use custom goto definition provider \n- use custom backlink definition provider\n- use schema based completions\n\n## Configuration\n\nTo enable server mode, update the following setting in your workspace settings `\"dendron.useExperimentalLSPSupport\": true`.

While both characteristics matter, we agree to make these tradeoffs when necessary. \n\n- function over form    \n    - in dendron, its more important for something to be useful than it is to be beautiful \n    - the focus in dendron should be about your content and the hierarchies that connect them\n- focus on speed\n    - we can't predict the future but its likely that no one will ever say that they wish their note taking experience to be slower\n    - when thinking about features and tool chain, bias for speed\n- focus on hierarchies\n    - while dendron supports backlinks and other forms of organizing notes, dendron's foundation is tooling to help you manage hierarchies\n- retrieval over insertion @kpathakota\n\n## Related\n- [[dendron.principles]]\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/35d7d7bc-64a6-4850-9a54-7de7f43ad751.html","relUrl":"notes/35d7d7bc-64a6-4850-9a54-7de7f43ad751.html"},{"doc":"Power functionality v0","title":"Power functionality v0","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.power-functionality","content":"# Power functionality v0\n\n## Goals\n\nSupport power user functionality \n\n## Details\n\nTBD\n\n## Tasks\n\n- schemas\n    - [ ] [specify sections within notes](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/248)\n\n## Next\nTBD\n\n## Links\n- [project docs](https://dendron.so/notes/ff1b9ea5-6d0e-49b2-97d1-a7e31299164e.html)\n- [issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/pro.power-func-v0)","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/ff1b9ea5-6d0e-49b2-97d1-a7e31299164e.html","relUrl":"notes/ff1b9ea5-6d0e-49b2-97d1-a7e31299164e.html"},{"doc":"Pods v0","title":"Pods v0","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.pods","content":"\n# Pods v0\n\n## Goal\t\n\nMake it possible for people to import/export their data between Dendron and **any other** platform that contains information a user might care about.\t\n\n## Details\t\n\nDendron wants to be your **central digital nervous system** - our end goal is to be the **best possible way** to create, build, use, and share the knowledge that matters to you. \t\nTo do that effectively, we believe its important that you have **full control of your information**.

The vision with pods is that you should be able to seamlessly move **your information** in and out a pod and in and out of Dendron. \t\n\nUnlike what the [notion](https://www.notion.so/) marketing folks might tell you, we don't believe there is a one size fits all approach when it comes to knowledge management, a concept that includes collecting articles, project management, journaling, collaboration, and basically any workflows that involve working with information.\t\n\nWhile Dendron will make it possible for you to do these things, it will also help you move your information to tools that do it better for a given use case. Imagine being able to collaborate on a note using [google docs](https://docs.google.com/), use the spreadsheet functionality in [airtable](https://airtable.com/) to organize and all the while keep a canonical copy of that note inside Dendron where it is just a lookup away. \t\n\nIf you have ideas about pods and pod related workflows that you would like to see us build, please come discuss them with us in our newly created [#pods](https://discord.gg/8vjasHj) channel. \t\n\n\n## Tasks\n- [x] establish basic pod framework\n- [x] use pods via extension\n- [x] use pods via CLI\n- [x] create 2 pods\n- [ ] support custom pods\n- [ ] document pods\n\n## Next\n- community voting on pods\n- stabilize pod API\n\n## Links\n- [project docs](https://dendron.so/notes/b1dbd32d-ca87-4489-9ba0-01bf7928cba5.html)\n- [issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/pro.pods-v0)\n\n## Related\n- [[dendron.topic.pod]]\n- [[pod proposal issue |dendron.roadmap.project.scratch.2020.09.07-164009]]\t\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/b1dbd32d-ca87-4489-9ba0-01bf7928cba5.html","relUrl":"notes/b1dbd32d-ca87-4489-9ba0-01bf7928cba5.html"},{"doc":"Multi Vault Support","title":"Multi Vault Support","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault","content":"# Multi Vault Support\n\n## Goals\n\nUsers should be able to create multiple vaults for a given workspace. Each vault is a folder that can contain any number of hierarchies. \n\n## Use Cases\n- for **sensitive notes**, multi-vault enables local only vaults vs vaults that can are synced on file sharing services like dropbox \n- for **modularizing knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to mix and match existing vaults depending on context\n- for **federating and curating knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to publish/subscribe to public vaults using protocols like `git`\n- for **access control**, multi-vault lets users configure specific vaults to be **private** which turns off publication and sharing of any notes inside said vault\n\n## Concepts\n\n((ref: [[dendron.concepts]]#workspace:#*))\n((ref: [[dendron.concepts]]#vaults 🚧:#*))\n((ref: [[dendron.concepts]]#workspace configuration:#*))\n((ref: [[dendron.concepts]]#hierarchies:#*))\n((ref: [[dendron.concepts]]#domain:#*))\n\n\n## Specs\n- a workspace can have one or more vaults\n- a workspace can have one or more workspace configs\n- vaults have a path relative to the workspace and an optional name\n<!-- - the initial vault is called `main` -->\n<!-- - vaults can be referred to by name using the `$` prefix  -->\n\n## Flow\n\n### Initialization\n\nTo facilitate separation and re-usability of vaults, we are changing how the initial workspace is laid out in Dendron.\n\nToday, all files (configuration, vaults, docs) are located directly inside the **workspace root**.\n\n((ref: [[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]#file layout for legacy workspace,1:#*))\n\nWith multivault, workspace configuration  will be moved underneath a separate folder underneath the **configuration root**. By default, this will inside a folder named **config**.\n\n((ref: [[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]#file layout for multi-vault workspace,1:#*))\n\nInside a multi-vault workspace, each vault and config will be initialized as separate and independent git repositories. To initialize a multi-vault workspace, you can run `Dendorn: Initialize MultiVault Workspace` to bootstrap the folder layout that you see above. \n\nWe will also be releasing a migration script that can convert a single vault workspace into a multi-vault workspace. \n\n### Configuration\n\nThe `dendron.yml` file will be modified to have additional metadata for vaults that have remote repositories associated with them. A remote root is not required unless you plan on cloning your workspace to other computers. \n\n```yml\nvaults:\n  - fsPath: vault1\n    remote:\n      type: git\n      url: /path/to/vault1/repo\n  - fsPath: vault2\n    remote:\n      type: git\n      url: /path/to/vault2/repo\n      branch: nightly # optional, target specific branch\n```\n\n### Cloning\n\nCloning is the act of checking out a workspace on another machine. To clone, Dendron will have the `Dendron: Clone Workspace` command. It will take the url of a remote **workspace configuration** repo as input as well as a local path for the **workspace root**. Cloning will checkout the *workspace configuration* underneath the *workspace root* and also checkout all the vaults that are associated with the configuration underneath the workspace.\n\n\n### Add a new Vault\n- run `Dendron: Add Vault`\n    - specify file path relative to the current **workspace root**\n    - specify an optional user friendly name for the vault\n        - if no name is set, the last component of the file path will be used\n- when the user hits enter, the vault is created as an \"empty vault\"\n    - empty vaults will contain a `root.md` and `root.schema.yml` file\n\n### Lookup\n\n((ref: [[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]#file layout for multi-vault workspace,1:#*))\n\n- lookup: {empty query}\n    - show all top level results of all vaults. note how the vault name shows up in parenthesis next to the result\n    - results\n        ```\n        root (vault1)\n        root (vault2)\n        foo (vault1)\n        foo (vault2)\n        ```\n- lookup: `vault1/`\n    - by prefixing lookup with the vault name, you can narrow results to a particular vault\n    - results\n        ```\n        root (vault1)\n        foo (vault1)\n        ```\n- lookup: `foo.`\n    - dendron will merge all results from all vaults when you do a lookup\n    - results\n        ```\n        foo.one (vault2)\n        foo.two (vault1)\n        ```\n- lookup: `foo.new`\n    - when you lookup a note that doesn't exist, you'll have the option of creating the note in either vault\n    - results\n        ```\n        Create New (vault2)\n        Create New (vault1)\n        ```\n    \n\n### Navigating Links\n((ref: [[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]#file layout for multi-vault workspace,1:#*))\n\n- navigating  to `[[foo]]` will result in a display prompting the user to select the vault to navigate to \n    - the UI should be similar to the **Peek Action**\n    ![](/assets/images/2020-10-19-20-48-52.png)\n\n- navigating to `[[foo.two]]` will directly navigate to the note since it is unique across all vaults\n- navigating to `[[vault1/foo]]` will open foo in vault1 \n\n### Moving Notes Between Vaults\n\n- TBD\n\n### Publishing Notes\n((ref: [[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]#file layout for multi-vault workspace,1:#*))\n\n- configuration to publish everything under foo\n    -

Dendron currently publishes using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using our own [template](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-jekyll). While this has served as well initially, slow compile times for large sites and difficulty of getting started has made it a growing pain point.\n\nTo address this, we've migrated our publishing stack to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a super fast javascript based static generator. This means much faster, and perhaps more importantly, easier publishing. \n\nThere's still some work left to integrate publishing into the Dendron plugin - meanwhile, you can take the new publishing workflow for a spin using the [[dendron cli|dendron.pro.dendron-cli]]\n\nIn order to to use the 11ty based publishing, initialize your workspace with the following commands.\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\nnpm install @dendronhq/dendron-cli@latest\nnpm install @dendronhq/dendron-11ty@latest\n```\n\nAfter you have your dependencies installed, build your your site using the following command.\n\n```bash\nnpx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot .  --stage dev --serve\n```\n\nThis will both compile your site locally and make it available at `localhost:8080` for instant preview. When building your site locally, the pages will be build to `{wsRoot}/build/site`. \n\n\nWhen you are ready to publish to github, make sure to change the stage to `prod`.\n\n```bash\nnpx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot .  --stage prod \n```\n\nThis will build your site to the path specified by [[siteRootDir|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#siterootdir]] in `dendron.yml`. \n\n#### Benchmarks\n\nPublishing V2 is ~10x faster than jekyll based publishing for sites with +100 pages. For comparison, below is the compilation difference between building the dendron site using 11ty vs jekyll. \n\n- 11ty: 24.45s\n- jekyll: 220.33s\n\nThere are additional optimizations still on the table that will further drive down he compilation time by another order of magnitude for future releases. \n\n#### Gaps\n\n11ty publishing is currently not at full feature parity with Jekyll publishing. Notably, the following features are missing:\n- setting a custom color theme\n- `edit on github` links\n- `jekyll-seo` functionality\n- mathjax\n\n#### Migration\n\nAll values that used to be written into `_config.yml` will now be moved into `dendron.yml`. You can see the currently supported configuration values here: `https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/types.ts#L71:L71`\n\nIf you currently have a Jekyll based Dendron page, note that the following settings have changed:\n- the `url` property from `_config.yml` is now `siteUrl` in `dendron.yml`\n- favicon is now controlled by `siteFaviconPath` in `dendron.yml` and is a path relative to your workspace root\n- `CNAME` is now controlled by `githubCname` property in `dendron.yml`\n\n#### Sample dendron.yml config\n- publishing without a cname\n```yml\nversion: 1\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\nsite:\n    copyAssets: true\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - dendron\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    siteUrl: \"kevinslin.github.io/dendron-11ty-test\"\n    usePrettyRefs: true\n```\n\n- using custom cname\n```yml\nversion: 1\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\nsite:\n    copyAssets: true\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - dendron\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    usePrettyRefs: true\n    siteUrl: \"11ty.dendron.so\"\n    githubCname: \"11ty.dendron.so\"\n```\n\n#### Sample repo\n- [github repo](https://github.com/kevinslin/dendron-11ty-test/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages)\n- [github page](https://kevinslin.github.io/dendron-11ty-test/)\n\n#### CLI Command Reference\n\n```bash\ndendron-cli buildSiteV2\n\nbuild notes for publication using 11ty\n\nOptions:\n  --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]\n  --help     Show help                                                 [boolean]\n  --wsRoot   location of workspace                                    [required]\n  --vaults   location of vault                                           [array]\n  --serve    serve over local http server             [boolean] [default: false]\n  --stage    serve over local http server\n```\n\n\n<!-- https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/10/to-eleventy-and-beyond/ -->\n\n## 0.19.3\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- be able to name remote vaults ([6da3973](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/6da39730f735f4700479f002f57d2a7802398ff5))\n- doctor command shouldn't create stubs ([e812f34](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e812f34246d88b007fb45ca03443a74ac27a5e62))\n- help command not working ([02fc08a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/02fc08a907e196b39c23db36b82565c15588673f))\n- nested git repos not showing up in source control view ([37adc5e](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/37adc5e528e0b9fa6c86105b39ebb40384023da4))\n- clicking a stub on tree view would show a false error ([ea0e17e](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/ea0e17e7ec8afed44cee1fd0fe442ba4c2064f92))\n\n## 0.19.2\n\n### Features\n\n#### Dendron Seed Bank\n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.seed-bank]]#seed bank,1))\n\n#### Support refactor for multi-vault \n\nOne of our most requested features for multi-vault is now out.

Prior to the UI, you would have to manually edit YAML to update the configuration. With the web ui, you no longer have to understand YAML and your changes will be validated before being saved. \n\nThe configuration editor is just the first step in making Dendron easier to use and expect to see more updates on this front soon.\n\nNote that the Web UI is still deemed experimental and functionality like keyboard shortcuts currently don't work.\n\nSpecial thanks to [Tyler Nieman](https://github.com/tsnieman) for the UI work!\n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.commands]]#configure,1:#*))\n\n\n### Enhancements\n- update config commands ([44dce76](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/44dce76b6fd447cd29a2f4f594632ef758eff927))\n- enable rename with multi-vault ([e26b294](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e26b294e8bbe1e49e44318152c247595e82639bb))\n- tree view and backlinks panel no longer appear when Dendron is not active (thank you [Christopher Corley](https://github.com/cscorley))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- rename would fail if backlink existed at root note\n- numerous fixes to refactor hierarchy\n\n\n### House Cleaning\n- the `Dendron: Configure` command will now launch the config editor with the web ui\n- the old `Dendron: Configure` command as been renamed to `Dendron: Configure (yaml)`\n\n## 0.17.1\n\n### Features\n#### Automatic Hover's for Links\n- add hover provider ([8d19a1b](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/8d19a1b47f114ae738f7483fd751b62f68b46d24))\n\nYou can now preview notes and references inside the editor as a hover without ever opening the link.

Multi Vault lets you add additional [vaults](https://dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html#vaults-) to your Dendron workspace.\n\nEach vault is logically separate (they reside in separate directories) but can be universally queried using lookup.\n\nMulti vault enables a bunch of exciting use cases.\n\n((ref: [[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]#use cases,1:#*))\n\nCurrently, the following commands are supported with multi-vault:\n- Lookup \n- Deleting a Note\n- Navigating to a note using Tree View \n\nOther commands like rename/refactor will still work when performed in your primary vault. They will probably not work if performed against a note not inside your primary vault.\n\nWhen you use **Lookup** to create a new note with multi vault, the note will be created inside the same vault as the current opened note. **Lookup** will also show you the vault that each note belongs to while performing lookup.\n\nCurrently known issues (with supported commands):\n- unable to create a note using Lookup that has the same name as an existing note inside **any** of your vaults \n- unable to navigating to the root of a vault using Tree View\n\n#### Vault Add Command\n\nAdd a new vault to your workspace. \n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/b4171372f9794dd7be609c043f343fa3\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n#### Vault Remove Command\n\nRemove a vault from your workspace. Note that the underlying files wil **not** be deleted - the vault will lose its association with your workspace.\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/307effc22b8d4c59a32933529a8393e1\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n### Enhancements\n### Bug Fixes\n- **engine:** init with empty config won't throw error ([7beb90f](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/7beb90fa243bc73563a3ce16b5305345f7348d9f))\n- **engine:** don't delete old note if new note wasn't created by rename ([de44f9f](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/de44f9f4d38651d75433ae885fdc78bb762fb1f6))\n- **notes:** fix issue when importing note that already exists ([a08a34a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/a08a34a0563bb4047bd9c7cfc5f2bf150873fdc8))\n\n### House Cleaning\n- vault metadata will be added to `dendron.yml`\n- `dendron.yml` comments will be stripped on workspace initialization\n\n## 0.15.1\n\n### Features\n\n#### Wildcard Note Ref Links\n- **refs:** wildcard note ref links ([98a1177](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/98a117715a967492ab9d7b8749d964b07bde4055))\n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.refs]]#wildcard note refs,1))\n\n#### Dendron: Configure Command\n- **workbench:** add configure command ([db51dc3](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/db51dc35864d0c4434f70620ef0e88451c198fa4))\n\nThis is a quick way to update the `dendron.yml` file.

All new workspaces are already running in server mode as well as well as users that have opted into it. This update transparently migrates remaining workspaces to server mode. \n\nAs a reminder, [[server mode|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]] is a re-architecture of Dendron that enables both better performance and a vast array of new features. \n\nFinally, we do have an escape valve in things something goes terribly wrong. You can set the following option to revert server mode behavior.

This turns out to be an anti-pattern that interferes with features like publishing which expect the workspace to be in a separate folder from its vaults.\n\n##

🚀🚀🚀\n\nThese commands have been completely re-written and use a proper markdown parser to find links (vs many fragile regex statements). \nThe re-write results in both much faster performance as well as a more correct implementation. \n\n### Enhancements\n\n- **progress indicator on startup (server mode)**: loading indicator to help with large workspaces\n- **rename command support (server

when publishing, you can now toggle whether you want to copy assets or not\n- **dump state**: dendron now has a `Dump State` command which will dump the internal state into the logs (useful for debugging)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- **assets not being copied:** assets not copied on publishing when `assetsPrefix` was set\n- **GoUp comman go to wrong note (server mode):** GoUp would sometimes try to open a stub node which would result in an error\n- **Multiple workspaces result in bad timestamps (server mode):** Having multiple workspaces of the same vaults open could result in bad timestamps\n\n### Documentation\n\n((ref: [[dendron.guides.troubleshooting]]#error upgrading:#*))\n\n## [0.12.8](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.8-alpha.2...v0.12.8)

The new engine is **leaner, meaner, and significantly faster** (especially when initializing your workspace with a large amount of notes).\n\nServer site indexing is a pre-cursor enables our upcoming roadmap items which include:\n\n- [[multi-vault support|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]\n- rich graphical interfaces for schemas, pods, and publishing\n- unified index for all dendron extensions (currently each extension makes a separate index of your notes and requires manual reloading)\n- realtime updates for graph extensions\n- custom dendron extensions written in any language \n\nServer side indexing is currently off by default since it's still a beta feature. You can turn it on by adding the following in your settings.\n\n```json\n\"dendron.useExperimentalLSPSupport\": true\n```\n\nNote that the current commands are currently un-available when you switch on on server side indexing:\n\n- RenameNote\n- Refactor Hierarchy\n- Archive Hierarchy\n- Realtime Schema Updates\n- Pod Commands\n\nYou can switch back to regular indexing at anytime by changing the above setting to `false` and running `> Developer: Reload Window`. \n\n### Enhancements\n\n- **Additional Arguments for lookup**: You can now use `noConfirm` and `value` arguments when creating custom lookup shortcuts ([docs](https://dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#passing-arguments-to-lookup))\n- **Update Default Snippets**: default todo snippet now leaves a space after insertion\n- **Set custom log levels**: you can now define the verbosity of dendron logs using the `dendron.logLevel` configuration\n- **Upgraded Schema defaults** (server only): new schemas will be created using version one defaults\n- **Cleaner note frontmatter** (server only): new notes won't have the optional attributes in frontmatter\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- **Missing logs**: issue where `Open Logs` would not show logs\n- **Tree View empty**: tree view would not populate in some cases\n- **Upgrade Snippets with comments**: Upgrading settings would fail if they had comments inside the JSON\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n- **Remove Scratch Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Scratch Note shortcut\n- **Remove Journal Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Journal Note shortcut\n\n### Progress\n\n#### Server Migration\n\nThese past two weeks have been spent on server migration work. We are almost at the end and I'm aiming to have full coverage of all existing functionality by early next week.\n\n((ref: [[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]]#tasks,1:#*))\n\n### Other\n\n- Add overview of [[configuration|dendron.topic.config]]\n- Add proposal for [[custom color tabs|dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog.color-tabs]]\n\n## [0.12.6](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.5...v0.12.6) (2020-10-07)\n\n### Features\n\n#### Default Snippets\n\nDendron now initializes your workspace with common default snippets\n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.snippets]]#default snippets,1:#*))\n\n#### Latex Support on Published Site\n\n((ref: [[dendron.pro.dendron-jekyll.topic.math]]#math,1:#*))\n\n#### Introduce siteRepoDir Customization\n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.publishing.configuration]]#siterepodir,1:#*))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- trying to publish the `dendron-template` no longer results in a missing links report\n- issue with schemas not showing up under lookup\n\n### Progress\n\nThis section tracks our progress against the milestones in our [[public roadmap|dendron.roadmap]]\n\n- [x] [[Seeds v0|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.seeds]]\n- [ ] Server migration, progress: 70/100\n  ```\n  - below is a summary of our progress. we are currently about half way done\n  - aiming to have a workable version using the Dendron server by next week\n  ```\n  ((ref: [[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]]#tasks,1:#*))\n\n### Other\n\n#### Seeds\n\n- We launched two [[seeds|dendron.topic.seeds]]. A seed is a dendron site that tries to be be a all encompassing reference for a particular vertical. Dendron provides specific libraries and CLIs that make it easy for users to create seeds from existing open source content as well as personal notes.\n\nCurrent Seeds:\n\n```\n- open PKM catalogue\n- open AWS catalogue\n```\n\n((ref: [[dendron.community.showcase]]#open pkm catalogue,1:#*))\n((ref: [[dendron.community.showcase]]#open aws catalogue,1:#*))\n\n#### Alternatives\n\nthis announcement also comes with an ask.

You can find the details of all this in the highlights below. \n\n## Highlights\n\n- move to the final phase of the [[server migration|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]] \n  - Dendron server mode is now at feature parity with existing functionality \n  - the server migration is a complete re-write of Dendron's internal to go from a client to client (local) server model\n  - this is pre-requisite for a bunch of upcoming features like [[multi vault support|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]], rich graphical interfaces, and realtime graph updates\n  - server mode will be the default for all workspaces going forward\n  - existing workspaces will be transparently migrated over after next week\n- order of magnitude speed improvements (server mode only)\n  - initializing large vaults\n  - updating links through `Rename` and `Refactor` operations \n- better note references\n  - note references can now be nested \n  - a reference to a header can be made by selecting any part of the header before running `Copy Note Ref`\n- better timestamps (server mode only)\n  - the `updated` timestamp on notes now updates on every save\n  - timestamp will now print a human friendly label \n- improved publishing\n  - dendron sites now support latex\n  - dendron will generate a bad link report for all links that do not resolve when publishing\n  - bad links will now resolve to a custom 404 link\n  - you can define a custom site repository that will be used by publishing commands\n- consolidated lookup\n  - creating journal notes and scratch notes are now part of the `Lookup Command` instead of being separate commands (the old keyboard shortcuts still work - they now map to lookup commands with custom arguments)\n  - lookup now accepts arguments that can be passed in via custom keyboard shortcuts\n  - you can control the creation of special notes as well as note selection behavior from lookup\n\n## Seeds\n\nAside from features, we've also launched two [[seeds|dendron.topic.seeds]]. Seeds are **open source dendron sites** that **consolidate reference material** about a **particular vertical**. Content from the catalogues is derived from existing open source content as well as manual user input. Your 🙏 is welcomed and encouraged. \n\n((ref: [[dendron.community.showcase]]#open pkm catalogue,1:#*))\n((ref: [[dendron.community.showcase]]#open aws catalogue,1:#*))\n\n## Sustainability\n\nFinally, a bunch of you have asked if you can support Dendron financially. The answer is coming at the end of the month! Dendron will be coming out of **preview** in November, at which point we will launch our **Environmentalist Plan** 🌲. This is a monthly subscription to support the development of Dendron. **Environmentalist** will get a special badge on Discord, priority email/discord access to the development team, and stickers! More details on this soon.\n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big to the following gardeners that brought up issues, contributions, and fixes to this release.\n\n- [Britt](https://github.com/bs)\n  - [silent log errors](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/277)\n  - various doc updates \n- [onwijsbegeerte](https://github.com/onwijsbegeerte)\n  - [bad export pod placeholder text](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/270)\n- [agichim ](https://github.com/agichim)\n  - [checkbox in preview doesn't render correctly](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/269)\n- [Emaro](https://github.com/Emaro)\n  - [treeview empty in certain cases](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/263)\n- [robothor](https://github.com/robothor)\n  - [issue refactoring with mixed case filenames](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/250)\n\n((ref: [[dendron.release.changelog]]#0.12.11,1))\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/1b1aef8e-c9d5-42de-b850-d1b1467cf88b.html","relUrl":"notes/1b1aef8e-c9d5-42de-b850-d1b1467cf88b.html"},{"doc":"2020-09-20 Release Notes","title":"2020-09-20 Release Notes","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-09-20","content":"\n# 2020-09-20 Release Notes (version 0.12)\n\nDendron 0.12 is here 🌱\n\nThis week's focus was on publishing. We have a bunch of enhancements and additions to the publishing workflows. We also introduced the [[seeds library|dendron.topic.seeds]], a way of you to remix existing content with Dendron. You can see an example of this [here](http://aws.dendron.so/)\n\nThis release also brings some changes to Dendron's update cycle. \nYou might have noticed that Dendron updates rather aggressively 🚀🚀🚀\n\nOur current release cycle is a patch update every day and a minor release every week. \nMoving forward, we will be doing patch updates every few days and a minor release every two weeks. \n\nThe move to this new release cycle is a reflection that Dendron is growing rapidly and starting to mature. \n\nWe will be working on some major changes in October to stabilize the core feature set and make them easier to use. We will also be shifting our underlying architecture from a VSCode plugin to the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) which will result in a richer feature set and the ability for Dendron to be more easily integrated into additional editors.\n\nAs part of this update, we've put out the first version of the [Dendron principles](https://dendron.so//notes/7fcebd7d-6411-4c9d-8baf-65629dc018a1.html) which reflects our design philosophies and the direction we are taking Dendron. \n\nThis is a work in progress so feel free to make suggestions and comments in the discord.\n\nI've mentioned this before but we will also be releasing our formal roadmap by the end of the month. This roadmap will cover all major projects we plan on doing in 2020. \n\nWe are looking to come out of preview by the end of October and do a formal 1.0 release before the end of the year. \n\nI want to take this moment to again thank everyone for being part of our journey to build a better tool for managing knowledge 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 \n\nI believe we're are planting something special here and am excited to see us grow 🌱 \n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n---\n\n\n## Cli\n### Support for seeds \n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.seeds]]#seeds 🚧,1:#*))\n\n\n### Enhancements\n- Standardize on core cli flags across all commands\n \n- More options when planting seeds\n \n\n## Hierarchies\n### Fixes\n- Rename when stub is present \n\n## Lookup\n### Lookup new notes with Selection \n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.lookup]]#creating notes with a selection,1:#*))\n\n\n### Enhancements\n- Lookup can extract highlighted text\n \n\n## Pods\n### Implement Json import pod \n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.pod.builtin.json]]))\n\n\n### Enhancements\n- All filepaths can be set relative to the workspace root\n \n- Json pod can import filenames as links\n \n- Standardize interface for import/export pod commands\n \n\n### Fixes\n- Handle stub notes correctly on import \n\n## Publishing\n### Publish command \n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.commands]]#publish,1:#*))\n\n\n### Copy note url command \n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.commands]]#copy note url,1:#*))\n\n\n### Enhancements\n- Support relative path for all file paths\n \n- Set custom path for publishing repo\n \n- Keyboard shortcuts for copy note url cmd\n \n- Be able to pass in custom args to commands\n \n- Support incremental page building\n \n\n### Fixes\n- Copy url truncates `//` \n\n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues, contributions, and fixes to this release.\n\n- [Denis Sikuler](https://github.com/gamtiq)\n    - update docs\n\n- [agichim](https://github.com/agichim)\n    - update docs\n\n- [Daria Vasyukova](https://github.com/gereleth)\n    - bug with copy note url\n\n- [Jack](https://github.com/JackQAQ-byte)\n    - issue with images on published sites\n\n- [Tom](https://github.com/peanutputter)\n    - [issue with image paths](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/200)\n\n- [Janne Ojanaho](https://github.com/jojanaho)\n    - [writeup on files vs folders](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/210)\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/8e59e25f-808c-42f1-a82a-e9ce4fd8edd8.html","relUrl":"notes/8e59e25f-808c-42f1-a82a-e9ce4fd8edd8.html"},{"doc":"2020-09-13 Release Notes","title":"2020-09-13 Release Notes","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-09-13","content":"# 2020-09-13 Release Notes (version 0.11)\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/comic.1.png)\n\n- My wife, Ilana Lin, drew a comic for this week's release.

You can check it at the [[showcase|dendron.community.showcase]].\n\nWe've also created a new role -> @Planter :man_farmer::woman_farmer: , to recognize folks who have published using Dendron.\n\nIf you have a site you would like to showcase, please ping Kevin ([kevin@dendron.so](mailto:kevin@dendron.so)) or edit the showcase page directly and adding your site :)\n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues, contributions, and fixes to this release.\n\n- [Fayçal](https://github.com/d3vr)\n  - giving us the dendron emoji\n\n- [Ed](https://github.com/ens100)\n  - updating various Dendron docs\n  - raise copy issue when publishing a dendron vault\n  - contribute new default completion settings for Dendron\n\n- [Daria Vasyukova](https://github.com/gereleth)\n  - updating docs\n\n- [Handuo](https://github.com/zhanghanduo)\n  - suggest [better block refs](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/174)\n  - suggest block refs autocomplete \n\n- [Mr. Lightbulb](https://github.com/JackQAQ-byte)\n  - [latex doesn't render when publishing](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/195)\n\n- [Tom](https://github.com/peanutputter)\n  - [Image Markdown fails with spaces and caps in name of file](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/200)\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/50071eda-fc46-4aca-ba6c-9d53db00d068.html","relUrl":"notes/50071eda-fc46-4aca-ba6c-9d53db00d068.html"},{"doc":"2020-09-06 Release Notes","title":"2020-09-06 Release Notes","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-09-06","content":"# 2020-09-06 Release Notes (version 0.10)\n\nDendron turns 0.10 today 🌲. To mark this milestone, the pre-amble for this release will be a tad longer (and more sentimental) than usual. \n\nThis week's release focuses on publication and exports. Dendron sites now come with [one click collaboration support](https://www.dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html#edit-on-github), [note references](https://www.dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html#note-references), and [hierarchy hints](https://www.dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html#nav-based-hierarchy-hints).

Since launch, we've passed over a thousand downloads and closed over [100 issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) worth of features, enhancements, and bug fixes. \n\nIn that time, we've built an awesome community of Dendrites on Discord now numbering in the triple digits. I feel beyond grateful to everyone that has given Dendron a try in these early days 🌱 and become a part of our budding community. \n\nSpeaking of community, I would like to recognize two new **Dendrologist** - [Fayçal](https://github.com/d3vr) (@bsqrd#9701 ) and [Janne Ojanaho](https://github.com/jojanaho) (@jojanaho#3766 ) 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾\n\nDendrologists are active members of the Dendron community that will be helping me shape our roadmap, answer questions, and collect feedback from all of you. If you've spent any time in our discord, you've probably already had chats with one or both of the folks I just mentioned.\n\nThat's all for last week's release. Stay tuned for some big announcements later this week :) \n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Development\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Bad import causes dendron to not compile in case-sensitive file systems \n\n## Engine\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix bad sibling traversal cases \n- Issue with mixed case file names \n\n## Markdown\n\n### Support offset with note refs ([[docs|dendron.topic.refs]])\n\nA note reference offset is a way to skip a number of lines when using a note reference. The syntax is `,{number}`. Below is an example of using a note reference offset to offset an initial heading, skipping the actual header when doing the embedding.\n\n- NOTE: currently, note reference offsets are limited to the first anchor inside a block reference. They must also be a positive value\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/31cb62916586453f8475f94ba68b74a1\">  <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/31cb62916586453f8475f94ba68b74a1-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Note refs will not be resolved when inside an inline code span or a fenced code block \n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix issue with preview checkbox not updating markdown \n- Fix issue with backslash causing in certain markdown blocks \n\n## Pods\n\n### Support note references when Publishing Notes ([[docs|dendron.topic.publishing]])\n\nDendron has [[note references|dendron.topic.refs]] that let you inline either the whole note or parts of a note into another note.

[Kiran Pathakoda](https://github.com/kpathakota) has been one of the first to adopt Dendron as his primary note taking platform and will be helping out with the development of Dendron.\n\nIn practice, this means Kiran will be hanging around the discord, help triage issues, and help me put together a more comprehensive public roadmap for the project!\n\nIf you're interested in being more involved with the development of Dendron (and this doesn't have to involve coding), feel free to ping me on Discord or by email at kevin@dendron.so.\n\nThere are a bunch of really exciting things that will be coming out over the next couple of weeks and we will need all the dendrologist we can get :) \n\n### New Channels\n\n- #dev: discuss all things related to Dendron development\n- #schemas: share and discuss schemas\n- #workflows: how do you take notes?\n\n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues and contributed fixes to this release.\n\n- [Jochen Burkhard](https://github.com/herop)\n- [Janne Ojanaho](https://github.com/jojanaho)\n- [Chris Na](https://github.com/buxel)\n- [Daria Vasyukova](https://github.com/gereleth)\n- [Denis Di Fazio](https://github.com/denisdifazio)\n- [nixsee](https://github.com/nixsee)\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/1a79e2a1-c906-4ed4-a528-15bd34c4e649.html","relUrl":"notes/1a79e2a1-c906-4ed4-a528-15bd34c4e649.html"},{"doc":"2020-08-23 Release Notes","title":"2020-08-23 Release Notes","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-08-23","content":"\n# 2020-08-23 Release Notes (version 0.8)\n\nSchemas and pods were the focus of this week's efforts. \n\nSchemas are now both more powerful and re-usable with a custom `pattern` attribute as well as the ability to `import` existing schemas. As a bonus, you can also visualize your schemas using the `Show Schema Graph` command!\n\nOn the Pod site, we've made the process of publishing a pod more flexible with per hierarchical configuration options, a unified config syntax and automatic reloading of your config on every publish. \n\n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n\n## Bundled extensions\n### Add ShowSchema Command ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/587e6d62-3c5b-49b0-aedc-02f62f0448e6.html#dendron-show-schema-graph))\n\nYou can now view your schemas using the same graph visualization as you do your notes!\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/graphs.show-schema.gif)\n\n\n### Enhancements\n- Dendron: reload graphs will reload both schema and note graphs \n- Dendron: reload graphs will reload both schema and note graphs \n- Dendron schema graph will show schemas by their title. if not set, revert to id. \n\n## Markdown\n### Enhancements\n- Markdown parsing can now be up to 300% faster publishing a site \n\n## Notes\n### Create Daily Journal Note Command ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/5c213aa6-e4ba-49e8-85c5-1bdcb33ce202.html#daily-journal))\n\nThe daily journal helps you keep a journal for each day of the year. By default, it will create the journal under `daily.{date}` though this is configurable by setting the `dendron.dailyJournalDomain`.\n\nYou can create a daily journal using `> Dendron: Create Daily Journal Note` or `CMD+SHIFT+I` shortcut.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/notes.daily.gif)\n\n\n## Pods\n### Support different defaults on a per hierarchy basis when publishing ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html#config))\n\nYou can now set different publishing defaults for each hierarchy (as well as general defaults for your entire vault.)\n\nAs an example, below is the config for [my website](https://kevinslin.com). It publishes everything under the `home` and `blog` hierarchies but will only publish notes under `books` if `published: true` is set on the frontmatter. \n\n- dendron.yml\n```yml\nsite:\nsiteHierarchies: [home, blog, books]\nsiteRootDir: docs\nconfig:\n    books:\n    publishByDefault: false\n```\n\n\n### Implement new website config syntax ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html#properties))\n\nNew config syntax unifies a bunch of different configuration options and renames others to more sensible names.\n\n\n### Enhancements\n- Auto migrate old-style site config to new style site config \n- Always read config before publishing. no more reloading the workspace after updating dendron.yml! \n- Update site config on dendron starter template \n- Use rsync to copy assets when building pods \n\n### Fixes\n- Use regular copy command if rsync not installed \n- Links not being converted to ids when publishing \n\n## Schemas\n### Support schema import ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#imports-optional-str))\n\nIt's now possible to import schemas! This means you can now create composable schemas from re-usable pieces.\n\nExample:\n\n- foo.schema. yml\n```yml\nversion: 1\nimports:\n- bar\nschemas:\n- id: foo\nparent: root\nchildren:\n    - bar.bar # notice that we prefix the id bar with the filename\n```\n\n- bar.schema.yml\n```yml\nversion: 1\nschemas:\n- id: bar\nparent: root\nchildren: \n    - one\n- id: one\n```\n\nThe above would match the following files\n\n```\nfoo.bar # match\nfoo.bar.one #match\n```\n\n\n### Support match by pattern ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#pattern))\n\nYou can now explicitly specify a glob pattern for any level of your schema. If not set, defaults to the schema `id`.\n\nThe following is an example of a schema for `journal` hierarchy. \n```yml\nschemas:\n- id: journal\ntitle: journal\ndesc: \"\"\nparent: root\nchildren:\n    - year\n- id: year\ntitle: year\npattern: \"[0-2][0-9][0-9][0-9]\"\nchildren: \n    - month\n- id: month\ntitle: month\npattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\nchildren: \n    - day\n- id: day\ntitle: day\npattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\nnamespace: true\n```\n\nThis will match the following queries\n```\n# journal\n# journal.2020\n# journal.2020.09\n# journal.2020.09.12\n# journal.2020.09.12.foo.md\n```\n\n\n### Enhancements\n- Set schema title to id if not set \n- Better error message on bad schema \n\n### Fixes\n- Autocomplete correctly on imported schema \n\n## Workspace\n### Fixes\n- A misconfigured POSIX path causes dendron to not load on windows \n\n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues and contributed fixes to this release.\n\n- [Devashish](https://github.com/ric03uec)\n- [Howard](https://github.com/runlevelrobot)\n- [komoda102](https://github.com/komoda102)\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/075e9806-0367-40a2-8154-2e84d5a1110.html","relUrl":"notes/075e9806-0367-40a2-8154-2e84d5a1110.html"},{"doc":"2020-08-16 Release Notes","title":"2020-08-16 Release Notes","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-08-16","content":"\n# 2020-08-16 Release Notes (version 0.7)\n\nThis is one of our biggest releases yet!

Because life is too short to annotate all your notes all the time. \n\n### Enhancements\n- Remove data field from new schemas: Schema notes only show you fields that are required on creation. \n  \n## Workspace\n### Enhancements\n- Update index when notes are deleted outside of dendron: We know that sometimes, it can't be helped and you'll need to work with your notes outside of Dendron. If that work is deleting notes, Dendron will now keep track of it and remove it from its lookup index as well!\n  \n## Other\n### Make Dendron available on [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/) ([docs](https://dendron.so/notes/9134f160-31a6-4ab0-a640-1fce466f9526.html#open-vsx))\n\nMaybe you just don't like Microsoft.

Notes are published under the [dendron-jekyll theme](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-jekyll). \n\n### Features\n\n#### Nested Hierarchies\n\ndendron-Jekyll supports the same nested hierarchies as your notes and allows you to navigate via the sidebar.\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-hierarchy.gif\" />\n\n#### Lookup\n\nIf you'd rather not click, dendron-Jekyll also supports path-based lookup.\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-lookup.gif\" />\n\n#### Permanent Ids\n\nEvery page is published using its unique ID which means that URLs will never change, even if the filenames do.\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-ids.jpg\" />\n\n#### Free hosting, custom domain names and SSL Certs\n\nIf you have a free GitHub account, then you can host your Dendron notes for free using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) \n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-domain.jpg\" />\n\n#### Jekyll Liquid Tags and Variables \n- NOTE: this will only be \"compiled\" in the published site but won't be rendered in the regular markdown \n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-liquid.gif\" />\n\n#### Selective Publication\n\nYou can choose to publish your whole vault or a single domain within your vault. \n\n- NOTE: It is not currently possible to publish multiple domains. If you would like this feature, you can vote for it [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/64).\n\n### Setup initial workspace to be ready for publishing \n([e1242b4](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e1242b494cc91b3284053b54dccecc4e4686ab7d))\n\nAll workspaces created from Dendron `0.5` onwards will have all the necessary configuration pre-loaded for publishing. \n\n## Schemas\n\nThink of schemas as an **optional type system** for your notes. They describe the hierarchy of your data and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy.\n\n### Enable lookup for Schemas \n([19b4677](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/19b46770fe6a842831692563de96ff4a823df871)) ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#schemas))\n\nThe process for finding schemas using Dendron is the same as that for finding notes. One lookup to rule them all. \n\nFind Schema\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-lookup.gif)\n\nCreate Schema\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-create.gif)\n\nDelete Schema\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-delete.gif)\n\n### Schema Templates \n([0205d66](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0205d66fc4538361322ffeabb3e532f0d541b775)) ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#schema-templates))\n\nSchema templates let you specify a pre-defined template that will automatically be applied to all notes that match the template. You can see a video of how this works below.\n\nThis is extremely useful whenever you want to re-use the outline of a note. Examples include daily journals, weekly shopping lists, and weekly reviews.  \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755-with-play.gif\"> \n</a>\n\n### Simpler Schema Syntax \n([d53ddb](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d53ddb73bfacc3f769db88cfd4f482a706dcb6dd))\n\nSchema syntax has been simplified. Before we had an extra `data` field to namespace the `namespace` field. We flattened all schema attributes to make the syntax more elegant. Note that the old styled `data` syntax is still supported but we recommend moving to the new syntax as `data` will be deprecated in a few releases.\n\n\n\n## Fixes\n\nBugfixes for this release\n\n- Fix issue with Journal Names on Windows ([d0bfe7f](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d0bfe7fb0288e8610fc4b177ee85697a8ebc3efe))\n- Stub nodes should keep parents when deleted ([f32f291](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/f32f291bc7a1ddd6c542483730e2db74b400dafa))\n- Issue with Urls in published site ([0ac8e75](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0ac8e75c95a9c4760e12bb301fc5b66b011ef0fb))\n\n\n## Enhancements\n- CI/CD testing ([d6ce68c](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d6ce68c720d7e8c96d7f4bb6ab390c1bd52c5218))\n  - Dendron now has continuous integration tests for all pushes. ![](https://travis-ci.com/dendronhq/dendron.svg?branch=master)\n  - Tests run on mac, linux and windows which means moving forward, there should be fewer OS (aka Windows) related issues \n- Update [quickstart docs](http://localhost:4000/notes/e86ac3ab-dbe1-47a1-bcd7-9df0d0490b40.html)  to showcase new features ([aec0fe0](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/aec0fe0939239d84f5b7ebd9ebae57a09bcdae43))\n\n## Next\n\nA teaser of some items we are working on for the next release.

And have you had a chance to play around with engine at all, or this is the first time.\n\n0:07  \nUm, I've opened it and read a little bit of the doc in it. And that's all I've done.\n\n0:13  \nOkay, cool. That's perfect. And so right now,\n\n0:17  \nwhen you turned up in the, in the, in the couple of discord threads was really the first point that I looked at it at all, and I haven't spent much time looking. And then you throw this out, like, Okay, this jumpstart.\n\n0:33  \nCool. Yeah. And that's kind of what this onboarding is for. It's, it's, you know, today's help, even if you haven't even opened it up just to give you the idea of, you know, why you might want to. And so right now, what you're looking at is identity and workspace, and the way so let's back up and tension. We manage your notes and our work states and if you use VS code, it's the equivalent of the VS code workspace. So that's a one to one match in there. And the way that you start off is you can initialize the workspace. And right now, I did me, we can just make a new one, like lead you. And so this is saying the workspace should be at this location. And so when we create a workspace, we can either create one with intention tutorial notes, and that has right or you can do an empty one. So I'm just going to do an empty one in this case. And so when you create an empty workspace, you have one file, which is the root file. And this is just there for this is kind of like your phone. And the way that denture and works is if you want to create a file, you can just type command L. I'm going to toggle screencast mode, command l triggers to look up bar, and most of the things you'll do in engine will involve this one have you used tools like Notational Velocity no So Notational Velocity, it's it was a tool where basically when you are looking for a file, for example, if I type Python, if the file doesn't exist, then it creates it for you. If it does, if that if it does exist, it will fetch it. So it's this idea that you never really have to think about\n\n2:22  \nthe accessing your data.\n\n2:26  \nAnd\n\n2:27  \nso I'm assuming that dendron is putting the is that a YAML? header?\n\n2:33  \nYes, that is a yamo header.\n\n2:35  \nSo it's just automatically doing that when it creates the file.\n\n2:39  \nExactly.\n\n2:41  \nAnd for the yamo header, the idea here is we store some metadata. So every node has a unique ID. And the reason we do that is because if you choose to you can publish your notes. That's my local version that this is the engine website is actually a published vault.\n\n2:59  \nAh, Why. So I created a\n\n3:03  \nworkspace with the with the help notes. Yeah. So that's why it looks the same.\n\n3:10  \nYep, exactly. And it is generated from the notes. And the reason and if you notice the IDs for each note, when you publish the notes are actually published by their ID not by the name. And what's nice about that is even if you've renamed the notes, as long as you keep the frontmatter, it will show publish to the same URL.\n\n3:29  \nInteresting,\n\n3:30  \nokay. And, okay, so, and as I'm battling off, if at any point, you want to just like stop me and say, like, hey, like, what's this? What would you guess? Do you just feel free to I tend to otherwise just keep talking?\n\n3:42  \nOh, no, that's fine. That's exactly what I was hoping. Okay,\n\n3:45  \nokay. Um, so creating, so as far as creating notes, you can type it. If it exists, it'll fetch it. If it doesn't then it it will create a another way of creating notes as using wiki links, which is double bracket syntax. So for example, if I wanted to go to Ruby, I could type in Ruby. And then if you do the go to definition shortcut, then you can go to default on Mac is something different. I just changed it to Ctrl, enter. So if I do Ctrl, enter, I can go into Ruby, sometimes some markdown preview, well, like, not update right away. But in, for example, in groovy, I can type in Python, and I can go here and I can go back to Python. And making these links, it's kind of the same thing as look up in like JavaScript, for example, JavaScript doesn't exist. But if I navigate to it, then venturing well creatively.\n\n4:42  \nThat's kind of the same way obsidian works.\n\n4:47  \nAnd it's just this idea that you shouldn't be thinking about the order of files. It's, you know, not likely and notetaking should just be the information that you're working with. And as far as bi directional linking On the left hand panel, so we have a backlink section. And the backlinks section shows you all the notes that this note is linked by. And so in Python, it's showing you that hey, Ruby links do Python. Yep. And I think obsidian has a similar panel, but it's, yeah, it's a backlink panel. Now, the thing that Oh, and I guess one more thing before I get into hierarchies, we support let's see, this is header one.\n\n5:35  \nThis is header Two,\n\n5:39  \none.\n\n5:43  \nSo denisha. We also support what we call defences, loan costs and block graph. I think loan costs and block references. We call them nodes references. I think obsidian also has a doe I'm not sure what they call it.\n\n5:58  \nI don't actually have this Same. There are references to headers and things, but they don't. It's a little different.\n\n6:07  \nRight? So what I'm going to show you is in dendron, you can embed notes and other notes. So for example, I just hit Command Shift R, which copy the left lens of this note, and the, and then I can paste it, for example in JavaScript. And so I'm seeing the Python notes embedded in the JavaScript note. You can either choose to reference a note, or you can choose to reference a header. So for example, everything starting from heading one, and you can also do games. So you can say everything starting from header one to header two, that you can embed notes into other nodes. And then the other thing that you can do is you if you keep bullets, the markdown preview is mutable in the sense that you can click on the lead and also update the markdown. Yes, that's a little thing that I find people get quite excited about that\n\n7:08  \nover if you're going to use to do if you're going to use those\n\n7:10  \nas to dues it's a big deal. Exactly. Um, okay, and now getting to the part. So right now what I've shown you it's pretty similar to obsidian it's pretty similar to go more like how normal note taking apps work. The things that dungeon the dungeon now starts doing differently is we're focused on having your notes conform to some sort of structure. And so that's not to say like, as you can see, like we support backlinks so you can link any note to any note. But the problem that I found and the reason why I made my own note taking tool is I find that once you get a lot of notes, you need some sort of structure, if you organize it, if it's all backlinks, like it becomes really hard to find something, whether it's a naming convention, whether it's some sort of hierarchy, like there need to be some sort of structure to help you find it. And so in Benjamin, for us that structure is hierarchy. So the way that you create a hierarchy, and Benjamin is whatever. So when you do command L, you the lookup bar gets populated by the current note that you're in. And so if you have not, then you're creating a new level in the hierarchy. So for example, I can do Python data. And so you know, this is a data node. But the hierarchy is, Python is parents data as a child. And under data, for example, I might want to do if I'm learning about Python, data could be you know, all of the various data structures that Okay, my path and setting I can look in billions and things. And the nice thing about this hierarchy is now instead of, you know, you manually having to link all the nodes together, because you are in the Python hierarchy, you can you have a bird's eye view of everything in this hierarchy.\n\n8:59  \nThat's just kind of Gaining\n\n9:02  \ninterest. Another way you can see the hierarchy is we have to show graph command. And so just like how obsidian has a graph, Python, now Python engine has a graph. But this is a graph with backlinks. It's a graph of your hierarchy. And so, you know, as you note, like there isn't a connection between Ruby and Python, even though there's a backlink, what this is showing you, you can think of it as a top down view of your table of contents of the hierarchies that you have. Right. Now, the nice thing about having this is like right now, for example, Python this in stone thing, that web engine lets you do, so let me back up for a moment. hierarchies, I find are one of the best ways of organizing notes by most people and most tools don't really support it as well. And that's because I think not because hacky some work, but because he had no tooling on our piece. Like if you had your files in a folder Actually, you could put them in a bunch of different folders, but then like finding them is more difficult. And then if you ever wanted to rename anything, that's just a nightmare. And so attention, we're building on this idea that it is actually some of the most effective ways of managing information with people. And we it's built around this idea that as hope you work with hierarchies, and one thing we let you view is we let you be factor. So for example, right now, I'm under a Python. But let's say that I shut off a entering text I want to replace. So I'm saying for Python instead of Python. Oops, let me again, instead of Python, go place Python with Lang Python. And what this is going to do is everywhere where you have python.md, it's going to add the Lang prefix for programming language. And if I hit proceed, proceed. What you'll notice is that not only did all the falaschi name but also If I go, for example, into movie, all the links to the palace, and also then. And so it's just an easier way of managing the hierarchies. And now, like, why might you want to do this? Well, because I have this just crazy thing. So because I have this programming language it, what it lets me do. And this is really what I started doing with my notes is, if I'm learning, for example, a programming language, and I'm working on like two or three at a time, it's really difficult to context switch between them. It's like, how do we do this in Ruby, how you listen to Python? What I found was much more conducive is if I could think like, okay, in a programming, what is my model for programming language. And so for example, a programming language has data structures, and so I could apply that to Ruby as well. So for example, for Ruby, it also has data structures. And then what I could do is when I'm learning about Ruby, you know, I could translate that higher He that I learned from Python, and put it into a movie. And what this lets me do now is, now it's a lot easier to context switch between different programming languages, because I'm thinking more about the concepts than the actual implementation. And for example, now, if I'm like in my hierarchy for So first of all, like, if I'm looking at data structures in Python, I have all of them in one view. But now let's say that I want to look up data structures for all my programming languages, then I also have a similar view for that. And so now, this idea, and this is where it really, for me, like, became like, the way that I did all my notes is having these hierarchies not only are they a great organizational scheme, because now instead of having 100, you know, 1000 notes at the top level, you only have, you know, the very good stuff behind this. So it's programming languages. It's cooking as you know. Few things that you care about at the top level, and you can drill down into them. And when you drill down into them, it's not just organizational. It's something that, for me, at least, it helps me learn about the topic. Because I find the heipiess that I create, for, you know, a programming language or anything, they affect my mental model of it. And I find over time, when I'm learning about things, it's not actually the implementation that matters, but it's the fact that I've been able to develop this hierarchy and then continue refining it over time.\n\n13:34  \nThat makes sense. Well, there's nothing that keeps you from just having a bunch of loose notes at some, somewhere even if, even if it's nothing. If for the sake of cleanliness, you you create a hierarchy starting with Miss and stuff under it. You have the same thing you have typically totally get the language thing. I once had a situation where I had the word two computer assembly languages. Yeah. And one of them had right to left operation on the instructions. And the other had left to right, but three quarters and now, three quarters of the names of operations were the same. So you just had to remember whether you were in left, right or right, left. So yeah, I totally get that.\n\n14:28  \nAnd the other thing that I do for these notes, and let me just going to show you this is my one of my vaults. This is a notes for a meeting today. But for example, I have a CI and this is like all the CI commands that I run into, and it's not just necessary. Oh, okay. So that one. It's like, if I run into a problem instead of, you know, googling it,\n\n14:55  \nyeah.\n\n14:56  \nI don't know how half a cache of it. So if I run into the same problem, they And, you know, I can just go into that COI hierarchy.\n\n15:04  \nAnd right because it's the one, it's the one. I did that last month. I know I know that, but I don't remember.\n\n15:12  \nExactly. And if you look at this, I think I have a couple of hundred different commands. And the nice thing about this as like, I did none of this, you know, ahead of time, it was kind of a just in time, I ran into cognitive work. I needed to Stack Overflow, it took me 10 minutes. I never want to spend time on it again. Let me go into, you know, yeah.\n\n15:36  \nOkay, cool.\n\n15:38  \nSo, can we look a little bit at, um, kind of your to dues?\n\n15:44  \nYeah. So, two dues let me actually, okay, I'm going to do two things. I'm first going to show you how you would create it from scratch and then I'll show you my two dues for the day. I like to organize things by projects. And so I usually have like a project hierarchy. Actually. And so for example, one project might be different. And so under dendron, what I actually do is I have a daily journal that I go over everything I need to do for that particular day. And let me think, what is the best way of showcasing, I'm just going to show you my to do actually.\n\n16:28  \nSo this is my to do for a dendron.\n\n16:32  \nAnd let me show you and the video. And what I do is intention, you have this notion of your journal notes. And so journal notes is basically whatever hierarchy you're currently in, and appends journal to it in the current date. And this is configurable. You can change the date format, you can change how it appends it, but I'm going to move on to tomorrow's date. And the way you do that is Ctrl Shift J. But you can use that to create a new Going on it. And then what I do is every day, are you familiar with snippets inside VS code?\n\n17:07  \nOh, I haven't used them inside VS code. I use external snippet code.\n\n17:14  \nWell, I, anyways, I use a bunch of snippets. And so apprehension journal snippet, and that will fill it out with\n\n17:21  \nOkay, might get the idea even though I haven't used it.\n\n17:25  \nYeah. And then the way I do two dues that's worked really well. For me, if I'm just working by myself, I have a snippet to make this bullet. And then I'll write you know, task one, task two tasks week.\n\n17:38  \nSomething that\n\n17:40  \ndension does fairly well is for example, sometimes like past one, it turns out to be a much bigger task and has a notion of sketch notes. And so let me and so this is all just special cases, it's you can create a sketch note by Command Shift s, and you can choose to add a title or not. If you don't add a title by default. It creates under your current high hierarchy denture and dots batch, and then the current date and timestamp. And you can think of this cache notice as caches, it's just, oh, I'm in a meeting, I need to take a note, I don't want to figure out where I'm gonna move it. So I'm just going to start you know, taking. And so that's kind of the purpose of discussion. And then later on, you can like rename it, and then follow it away somewhere if you want to. The more interesting thing is, if I highlight tasks, for example, and then I do the shortcut for a sketch note, what it does, is it creates a link from this task to the sketch note. And so now, you know, I can use this to create nested tasks. So you know, task 1.1 1.2 and if I find that, you know, task 1.1 is still too big, and I need to break it down even further. I can create another cash flow from that and then you know, create even more tasks. So you can go as deep as you want to that I usually find that to be To TCP level sign up yeah\n\n19:04  \nthat deeper probably needs to be broken up\n\n19:08  \nand but what's really cool about this is you can start off with a bullet and you can still keep this nicely bulleted list but then you can you know, expand upon it as much as you need to. Um, but as far as like project management goes the way I manage projects is I have my daily to dues and then I look at my to dues from the previous day. And then like anything I haven't done the previous day, I will copy it over into today. And then I will I use a bullet journal format so like I will add like a lesson sign.\n\n19:47  \nGo No, I don't use it, but I'm familiar with it.\n\n19:51  \nAnd something else that you can do is this is VS code feature more than attention feature better And then most people don't know about this. If you notice, for example, I have tags to some of my tasks, what I can do VS code has a search editor feature where you can search within your current note. And so if I type in start, it shows me For example, all my lines were have to start counting. And what's cool about this is this search is globbing. And so what I can do is by I have this shortcut set up, that brings me a search of whatever the current notice, but I can, for example, go here to show me Okay, what are all my past titled start within this month? And this shows me all of that materialized in a single view. All right, go What is everything, you know, in this year, or, you know, it's a quote skyjack so you can get as fancy as you like, and what what I will say this like this search, edit I view it's a VS code thing, not an engine thing, but it's Because the engine, if you follow dingemans method of putting stuff in hierarchies, it makes us search things super powerful, because now you can glob and search within. Yeah, the big dates. You can, for example, if you think back to a programming example, in Python, you can search, you know, under Python, everything in Python that has a gotcha tag, or everything in programming languages, that was hard. And that is something that you get for free with the hierarchy. This is nicely structured, being able to just search everything within that.\n\n21:38  \nSo what's really fascinating about this for me to watch, is that the name that you get, which is the hierarchy with with dots as separators on the mainframe, that's actually how hierarchical folder structures are achieved. Yeah,\n\n22:01  \nthat exact naming convention.\n\n22:04  \nNice. I haven't had the pleasure of using many mainframes in the days.\n\n22:09  \nYeah, so that was that one harks back, like decades for me. Okay.\n\n22:14  \nUm, so I have an unrelated question, what is the tool you're using? That's echoing the keystrokes. And that's actually VS code. So VS code has something called screencast mode. I'll go ahead, it will show you all the keystrokes.\n\n22:29  \nCool. All right.\n\n22:31  \nAnd that's a nice thing about building engine inside VS code is that, for me, like what was different about attention and what the thing I'm trying to promote is this idea of keeping your notes in a hierarchy and giving you the tools to work with that hierarchy. But then all the other stuff, for example, like being able to work with markdown and supporting multiple panes and having all the other stuff that you need in an editor. It's not really differentiating and you codecademy is a great place for that. And plus you have all the extensions. And VS code has and VS code has like a lot of new features. One of them another one that I really like that I find most people don't know about is you can toggle lines. So if you do option, arrow key, you can move lines up and down. And I find that really nice for prioritizing because I usually like to, you know, keep stuff in this sort of format. And this way, I can easily move stuff down when I'm done. And what's cool is it's not just a single line, you can highlight a whole block and you can move that whole block at a time. But it's just another one little known feature that I find it makes a big quality of life. Yeah.\n\n23:48  \nLet's see.\n\n23:51  \nUm, this. That's the other thing that you can do. indention is you can paste images. I find that's a question I get a lot specially with Mark And so I use a program called sketch, which lets me take a screenshot of the screen. And then if I do Command Shift C, it puts that image into my clipboard. And then inside address, you can kinda paste image command, which will take whatever is in your clipboard, put it in this path in the vault. And then now you have the picture. And I find that useful because I in markdown paste ads at night, adding media is usually like a problem that people have.\n\n24:32  \nYeah, obsidian handles that pretty well, much the same way. So yeah, that one I haven't had a lot of friction on.\n\n24:41  \nAnd\n\n24:42  \nthat's really interesting.\n\n24:45  \nYeah, the hierarchy is definitely the thing that I am working upon. And oh, one thing I haven't shown you and this is more of an advanced feature, but you can create schemas for your hierarchies and you can think of femurs is kind of being able to type check. And so I'll show you what I mean by that. So right now I'm creating a lens. And the way I go to schema is I do Command Shift L. And this shows me all the schemas that I have. So it's kind of lookup, but instead of looking for markdown files, I'll explore YAML files. And so your schema, it is just a yamo. And it follows. And what it does, so is it says that, okay, there is a node that is named. And so Lang is the root of your hierarchy. And you can, for example, say that this has children. So for example, Python, it's Ruby. And the only thing you need to specify for the children is that they exist. And now you need to reload the index between schema changes because it hasn't picked up on Live, that's going to change later. But now, if I go into my lookup, if I type in Lang, for example, you'll notice it's actually a little book to it. And the little book over here means that hey, Lang is part of the schema. And if I go down, I can see that Oh, like there's a little book next to Python. That's part of the schema. If you look at JavaScript, because I created\n\n26:31  \nit. It's not in the schema, if you look at Java, this little question mark, because it's not in the schema. And the reason you might want to do this is for example, like as I'm building my hierarchy, oh, one thing is you don't have to like enumerate everything. So this a namespace property where you can say this is a namespace. And so now, this is essentially saying that this is going to match now Not start the globbing pattern. The scheme is just based off this simple globbing pattern\n\n27:06  \nthat would pick up if it existed.\n\n27:08  \nYeah. And so now if I go to Java, this little book to it, because that's in a sec, okay, I recognize it. Now, the interesting part here is now for my children, for example, if I say data,\n\n27:21  \nso data structures,\n\n27:24  \nand you know, and data, let's say that as their children, like, spring, I have a lot of different autocompletes. So that Well, sometimes,\n\n27:38  \nyeah, no, I know how that works. I get that a lot. Yeah.\n\n27:43  \nSo let's say that I crave\n\n27:46  \nthat. And so this schema of the way that the globbing patterns work is the children will inherit the parents as a prefix. So this will match Lang dot star dot data. And then string will match Lang dot star dot data watchman. But the schema is also hierarchal. And so now, if I reload my index, if I go to lang.db, dot away, for example, there's a book, because it's part of my schema. But if I look into your data, that Boolean does nothing, because it's not part of my schema. And schemas are really lightweight. It's just that yamo and we don't stop you from creating things outside of your schema, we just show you a question mark. But it's nice. For example, if you're building a programming language hierarchy, and just like sometimes use Google, sometimes use Boolean and you want to keep it consistent, you can document it in your schema. And the engine will also tell you when you're going outside of it, and in the future, we'll add options if you want you to actually enforce it. So you can say like, hey, like, actually don't have any great things that go outside of this. Okay? And that's just because like if my this is how likely entropy builds up and up looks like you name one thing for one fee and then another one for another, and then you have a million different things.\n\n29:07  \nYep, I have, I have several backlinks that I have to go clean up because I did somebody's name or title or something differently in two different places.\n\n29:20  \nl and schema strike now. We are also this going to be more features that you can do with schemas. And right now, it does two things. One is it gives you the little book with a little question mark, if you're in a note that matches it. The other thing is you can assign templates to it. So for example, for this thing, I can say that it has a template. And what that means is when I create a note that matches the schema, automatically apply this template to it. And so the idea of this template is going to be the name of another note. And so for example, if I just do a Lang, template, M and M Then I can say this is something inflige. And it's a note template. And the reason you have this this in the future will have different types of templates, you can make templates from snippets, or other sources. And now if I reload my index, and let's create a screen for something I don't have fishing for so let's say Lang dot java data archwing. And oh, something else that schemas that you do is it autocompletes so like, even though again, string haven't been created, it shows you Hey, this matches the dang schema. According to that schema, you happen assumptions.\n\n30:40  \nNice. So if I type in train,\n\n30:46  \nit shows you how demos will always break your hearts.\n\n30:52  \nOf course,\n\n30:54  \nthat's me.\n\n30:57  \ndelete this. So Command Shift D is to do Return note.\n\n31:03  \nAnd\n\n31:06  \nlet's try this again. I might have to reload the window for it to pick it up. So, let me I just reloaded the window. I'm going to delete this and then try to create it one more time. And then hopefully, but\n\n31:26  \nOkay, I'll look into that. But so yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.\n\n31:37  \nAnd there are other things, but these are essentially like the core parts of dendron. Something else that you can do is you can take your notes, and you can publish it to GitHub. So that's a build command. Right now, because we're in an empty space, you need to run another command to add in some pals, but basically what that when you do build power On a workspace is that it can, it'll generate, it'll turn it into static files that you can publish to GitHub. And it'll have the same template as an engine website. Um, and it's also hierarchical. So you know you the same hierarchy you happen engine you can have on your website, you can choose to publish either everything in your vault, or you can choose which hierarchies you want to publish. And then the other thing is this search bar here. This is actually also path based. So the same lookup mechanism that you use insight engine, you can also use on an engine website.\n\n32:42  \nNice. Yeah.\n\n32:43  \nCool.\n\n32:44  \nYep. Well, thank you. Yeah, no problem.\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/097cf7ed-e9aa-4580-86cf-0347bf7a623d.html","relUrl":"notes/097cf7ed-e9aa-4580-86cf-0347bf7a623d.html"},{"doc":"Titles","title":"Titles","hpath":"dendron.ref.titles","content":"\n# Titles\n\nWe recommend using all lower kebab case when naming your files.

Use `Run Extension` from the [[debug pane|dendron.dev.ref.vscode#debug-pane]] (note: this requires that dendron be installed. VSCode might ask you to install Dendron and reload at this point)\n1. Make sure you are inside a Dendron workspace. If not, either initialize one using `Dendron: Initialize Workspace` or change to one using `Dendron: Change Workspace`\n\n\n## Setup without Dendron Extension Installed\n\nDendron markdown links depends on the dendron extension to be active. You can still make it work without the extension by the following instructions:\n\n1. Comment out the following in `package.json`\n    ```json\n    \"extensionDependencies\": [\n        \"dendron.dendron\"\n    ],\n    ```\n2. Follow step 2 in the setup instructions above.\n3.

In that case, you must set `published: true` in order to publish a page under the given hierarchy. \n\nYou can also set this to `false` to selectively withhold specific pages from publication. \n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.publishing.configuration]]#config:#*))\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/f9c646b1-34ab-4b18-8ec1-cabb8b2c7066.html","relUrl":"notes/f9c646b1-34ab-4b18-8ec1-cabb8b2c7066.html"},{"doc":"Dendron Engine","title":"Dendron Engine","hpath":"dendron.pro.dendron-engine","content":"\n# Dendron Engine\n\nThe engine provides the core of dendron's capabilities. \n\n# Components\n\n## Fuse.js\n- https://fusejs.io/- \n- powers dendron fuzzy search\n\n### Cook\n\n#### Tune Search Results\n1. checkout fuse.js from https://github.com/krisk/fuse\n1. install dependencies \n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n1. build the docs\n    ```bash\n    npm run docs:dev\n    ```\n1. modify `docs/.vuepress/components/Demo/Demo.vue`\n    - example of setting custom parameters\n    ```js\n    let codify = (pattern) => {\n    return `const options = {\n        shouldSort: true,\n        threshold: 0.6,\n        location: 0,\n        distance: 50,\n        maxPatternLength: 32,\n        minMatchCharLength: 2,\n        useExtendedSearch: true,\n        includeScore: true,\n    keys: [\n        \"title\",\n    ]\n    };\n\n    const fuse = new Fuse(list, options);\n\n    // Change the pattern\n    const pattern = \"${pattern}\"\n\n    return fuse.search(pattern)`\n    }\n    ```\n\n## Related\n- [[Server Migration|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]]","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/5a7103be-eb92-4380-8207-598e9f10724c.html","relUrl":"notes/5a7103be-eb92-4380-8207-598e9f10724c.html"},{"doc":"Internal","title":"Internal","hpath":"dendron.pro.dendron-engine.internal","content":"\n# Schema\n```\n  \"root\": Object {\n    \"fname\": \"root\",\n    \"imports\": Array [],\n    \"root\": Object {\n      \"children\": Array [],\n      \"id\": \"root\",\n      \"parent\": \"root\",\n      \"title\": \"root\",\n    },\n    \"schemas\": Object {\n      \"root\": Object {\n        \"body\": \"\",\n        \"children\": Array [],\n        \"created\": 1605108880847,\n        \"data\": Object {},\n        \"desc\": \"\",\n        \"fname\": \"__empty\",\n        \"id\": \"root\",\n        \"links\": Array [],\n        \"parent\": \"root\",\n        \"title\": \"root\",\n        \"type\": \"schema\",\n        \"updated\": 1605108880847,\n        \"vault\": undefined,\n      },\n    },\n    \"version\": 1,\n  },\n```\n\n# Renaming a Note\n\n## Flow\n\n- engine-server/src/drivers/file/storev2.ts\n\n```ts\nrenameNote opts {\n  oldNote, oldLoc, newLoc := opts\n  notesToChange = getNotesWithLinkTo(oldNote)\n  notesToChange.forEach { n =>\n    replaceLinks(n, from: oldLoc, to: newLoc)\n    n.links = findLinks(n)\n  }\n  newNote = {oldNote, newLoc}\n  @deleteNote( oldNode, metaOnly)\n}\n```\n\n- src/topics/markdown/utilsv2.ts\n```ts\nreplaceLinks opts {\n  remark = getRemark(dendronLinksOpts: {replaceLink: { from, to }} )\n  return remark.process(opts.content).toString()\n}\n```\n\n- src/drivers/file/storev2.ts\n\n```ts\ndeleteNote(note) {\n  ...\n  if !note.children {\n    ...\n  } else {\n  }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n- See [[Remark|dendron.dev.design.remark]]\n\n\n# Specifics\n\n### Does Dendron use parent/children metadata inside notes during initialization?\n\n- src/filesv2.ts: `string2Note`\n\n# WorkspaceService: Add Vault\n\n- src/workspace.ts\n```ts\ncreateVault(vault, noAddToConfig):\n  ensureDir(vault)\n  createNoteRoot if not_exist\n  createSchemaRoot if not_exist\n\n  if !noAddToConfig:\n    config.add vault\n```","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/26be950a-eaf3-4684-bddd-64be52273b73.html","relUrl":"notes/26be950a-eaf3-4684-bddd-64be52273b73.html"},{"doc":"Dendron-cli","title":"Dendron-cli","hpath":"dendron.pro.dendron-cli","content":"\n# Dendron CLI 🚧\n\nThe Dendron CLI exposes Dendron's functionality via the command line. \n\n## Installation\n```\nnpm install -g @dendronhq/dendron-cli\n```\n\n## Engine Commands\n\n### doctor 🚧\n\nUse doctor to perform specific fixes over your notes. \n- NOTE: the functionality here is different from what is available in the plugin version of [[Doctor|dendron.topic.commands#doctor]]. \n\n```bash\ndoctor helps you fix your notes\n\nOptions:\n  --version     Show version number                                    [boolean]\n  --help        Show help                                              [boolean]\n  --wsRoot      location of workspace                                 [required]\n  --enginePort  If set, connecto to running engine.

You can skip this initial indexing if you have a current Dendron workspace running. \n\nIn that case, the CLI can connect to the current engine instead of starting a new one using the following command. \n\n```bash\ncd {root/of/workspace}\n# .dendron.port has the port of the current running workspace\nnpx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot . --stage dev --serve --enginePort `cat .dendron.port`\n``` \n\n## Pod Commands\n- NOTE: you can find pod ids in the [[pods|dendron.topic.pod]] page. Just add a `.import|.export` to the end of the id (eg. `dendron.pod.json.import`)\n\n### Export Pod\n- export a pod\n\n- eg: Export notes to JSONPod\n```\ndendron-cli exportPod --podId dendron.json --wsRoot . --vault \"vault\" \n```\n\n### Import Pod\n\n- eg: Import notes from FilePod\n```\ndendron-cli importPod --podId dendron.markdown --vault \"/Users/kevinlin/Dendron-es/vault\" --podsDir /Users/kevinlin/Dendron-es/pods\n```\n\n### Publish Pod\n\n- eg: Publish a note as regular markdown\n```bash\ndendron-cli publishPod --wsRoot . --vault ./vault --podId dendron.markdown --noteByName dendron\n```\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/8b03ed06-4f46-46e0-8652-c6abf2266a79.html","relUrl":"notes/8b03ed06-4f46-46e0-8652-c6abf2266a79.html"},{"doc":"Dev","title":"Dev","hpath":"dendron.pro.dendron-cli.dev","content":"\n\n## Issues\n\n### Unexpected Token\n  name: 'EleventyConfigError',\n  originalError:\n   /codebuild/output/src896656404/src/staging/node_modules/@dendronhq/dendron-11ty/libs/utils.js:68\n     static getUrl = (note) => {\n   SyntaxError: Unexpected token =","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/832a6e4d-4ed9-414f-baa8-d2f20432c934.html","relUrl":"notes/832a6e4d-4ed9-414f-baa8-d2f20432c934.html"},{"doc":"Dendron-api-server","title":"Dendron-api-server","hpath":"dendron.pro.dendron-api-server","content":"\n\n# Ops\n\n### Initialize a workspace\n- NOTE: specific to kevin's vault, modify for your own\n\n```bash\ncurl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:3005/api/workspace/initialize' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"uri\": \"/Users/kevinlin/Dendron\",\n    \"config\": {\n        \"vaults\": [\"/Users/kevinlin/Dendron/vault\"]\n    }\n}'\n```","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/554d3c62-29da-4c86-9d16-f910e36ad7b1.html","relUrl":"notes/554d3c62-29da-4c86-9d16-f910e36ad7b1.html"},{"doc":"Dendron-11ty","title":"Dendron-11ty","hpath":"dendron.pro.dendron-11ty","content":"\n## Repo\n- https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-11ty\n\n## Install dendron-11ty\n\n```bash\nyarn init\nyarn add @dendronhq/dendron-11ty\n```\n\n```\n# start server\nenv LOG_LEVEL=info dendron-cli launchEngineServer --port 3010 --wsRoot .\n\n# start eleventy\nnpx den-11ty --wsRoot=. --port 310 --serve\n```","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/53dd4b9b-d3a7-4398-9511-b7a281039f9d.html","relUrl":"notes/53dd4b9b-d3a7-4398-9511-b7a281039f9d.html"},{"doc":"Principles","title":"Principles","hpath":"dendron.principles","content":"\n\n# Principles\n\n## Product\n\n### Speed\n\nDendron should be the fastest way for **people** to access the information they care about.\n\n- lookup should finish in under a second\n- all parts of our toolchain should optimize for speed\n\n### Scale\nDendron should become easier to use as you accumulate more notes. \n\n### Ownership\nUsers should have **full control** of their data and it should be our first principle to maximize this as much as possible.\n\n### Interoperability\n\nIt should be possible to import/export your data from/to any other source where a user might want to use their information.\n\n### Easy to learn, hard to master\n- see [Bushnell's Law\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushnell%27s_Law#:~:text=Bushnell's%20Law%20or%20Nolan's%20Law,first%20quarter%20and%20the%20hundredth.)\n\n## Community\n\n### Open and Inclusive\nDendron is a tool for **all users** that are interested in creating, building, using, and sharing knowledge. full stop. \n\n### Have it in writing\nWe don't just share what we learn in a chat at a moment in time.

At that point, you should be able to narrow down the root cause to one of the issues below. If not, please bring it up on the [discord](https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9) or file a [bug report](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=)\n\n## General\n\n### Engine not initialized\n\nThis is most likely due to the VSCode [workspace file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_opening-workspace-files) not being open. Make sure to open the **dendron.code-workspace** file by following the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_opening-workspace-files)\n\n### Notes from the graph/tree view are out of sync\n\nRun `Dendron: Reload Index` to manually sync. If that doesn't work, you can also try `Developer: Reload Window` to restart VSCode.\n\n## Upgrading\n\n### Error upgrading\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/trouble.upgrade.png)\n\nDendron will update keybindings/settings/etc to the latest defaults if not currently set on upgrade. If you see the above error, it means that Dendron had trouble parsing one of your settings files. This doesn't stop dendron from starting but it does mean that the latest settings aren't being applied.\n\nThe most likely culprit of this error is a bad snippets file. To fix, bring up the command prompt, type `>Configure User Snippets`, open `dendron.code-snippets` and see if there's anything funky with the json on the line mentioned by the error. You can also use tools like [jsonlint](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate your JSON.\n\n## Schemas\n\n### I'm getting a `you cannot define a mapping item when in a sequence` when trying to define a schema\n\nThat means there's an issue with your yaml. You can paste it in [yaml lint](http://www.yamllint.com/) to check that you are using the correct yaml syntax. \n\n### Schema Templates aren't working\n\nSchema templates are defined as YAML objects. The most common mistake is putting them down as a list\n\nFor example, this is a valid schema.\n\n```yml\n- id: journal\n  title: journal\n  desc: \"\"\n  parent: root\n  children: \n    - daily\n- id : daily\n  namespace: true\n  template:\n    id: journal.template.daily\n    type: note\n```\n\nThis is not a valid schema.\n\n```yml\n- id: journal\n  title: journal\n  desc: \"\"\n  parent: root\n  children: \n    - daily\n- id : daily\n  namespace: true\n  template:\n    - id: journal.template.daily\n      type: note\n```\n\n## Markdown Preview\n\n### Why can't I click the checkbox?\n\nIt could be that you are using the VSCode default markdown instead of Dendron's Markdown Preview. \n\nThey both have identical icons and its currently not possible to disable the builtin preview (we are looking into fixing this [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/42)).\n\nMeanwhile, you can open Dendron's markdown preview by clicking the preview button on the left of the menu bar or by using the `> Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open Preview to the Side` command\n\n![Markdown preview](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/trouble-md.png)\n\n\n## Linux\n\n### Reference to Another Note on Ubuntu\n\nIf Ctrl+Shift+R (reference to another note) doesn't work on Ubuntu, do `sudo apt install xsel`.\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/a6c03f9b-8959-4d67-8394-4d204ab69bfe.html","relUrl":"notes/a6c03f9b-8959-4d67-8394-4d204ab69bfe.html"},{"doc":"Tips","title":"Tips","hpath":"dendron.guides.tips","content":"\n## Bucket\n\n### Peeking\n\nIt is possible to [peek](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_peek) at wiki-links in Dendron.

This is really helpful for prioritizing todos among other things ✅\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips-move-lines.gif)\n\n### Search Editor\n\n- [docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_43#_search-editors)\n\nAlso known as the coolest feature in vscode that most people have never heard of. This lets you view and save your search results in a full blown text editor. You can combine it with Dendron's hierarchies to do some amazing things, like aggregating all your todos. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.search-editor.gif)\n\nYou can open search editor via keyboard shortcut. I use it to start a search with the current filename. works really well with Dendron hierarchies.\n\n```json\n  {\n    \"key\": \"ctrl+s f\",\n    \"command\": \"search.action.openNewEditor\",\n    \"args\": {\n      \"query\": \"\",\n      \"triggerSearch\": false,\n      \"focusResults\": false,\n      \"includes\": \"${fileBasenameNoExtension}\",\n    }the following line\n  }\n```\n\n### Stylized Tags Using Custom CSS\n\nTo customize the look and feel of your tags, you can do so by using the following convention and [CSS edits](https://www.dendron.so/notes/683740e3-70ce-4a47-a1f4-1f140e80b558.html#can-i-customize-the-markdown-preview-css).\n\nLet's say you have a `books` hierarchy and you have a `books.high-growth-handbook` note. You have all the tags you use for books under a `books.tags.` namespace.\n\nIf you use links for tags: `[[#business|books.tags.business]]`, you can use this CSS to customize their look:\n\n```css\n/* General tag styling */\na[href*=\".tags.\"] {\n    color: #000;\n    background: #fff;\n    display: inline-block;\n    padding: 0 10px;\n    border-radius: 4px;\n}\n/* Customizing the look of specific tags */\na[href*=\".tags.business\"] {\n    color: #fff;\n    background: rgb(36, 89, 233);\n}\n```\n\nThe result looks like this:\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tags.png)\n\n### Collapsing Headers and Bullets\n\nYou can collapse headers at different levels and bullets at different indentation levels inside VSCode. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.toggle-bullets.gif)\n\n\n### Create a new note in a deeply nested hierarchy \n- [discord thread](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/735365126227493004/758235198403117087)\n\n- Problem: \n   - You are currently in `foo` and you want to create the note `foo.child1.child2.my-note`. You don't want to type out the full path. Is there an easier way to create `my-note` than typing out the full path?\n- Solution: \n  - VSCode doesn't support autocomplete inside the quick input widget which Dendron uses for lookups. We are experimenting with different ways of getting around this. \n  - Today, the workaround is to create a wiki-link inside another note and navigate via link to create it. \n  - Another method, if you know you will be creating multiple children under a single deeply nested parent, is to pin the parent and create the child from the parent \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/f0bbfc9cae0a474a99f8a1169b7b96c7\">\n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/f0bbfc9cae0a474a99f8a1169b7b96c7-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n\n### Automate Git Tasks\n- [discord thread](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/742532267058004098/759130627781558403)\n- Problem:\n  - You want an easier way to `git add && git commit && git push`\n- Solution\n  - Use [git automator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ivangabriele.vscode-git-add-and-commit).\n\n### Publish to GitHub Pages with Actions\n\n- [discord thread](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/749641193322971238/759190468671438848)\n\nIt's possible to publish your Dendron site to GitHub Pages without the shadow copy of your notes in the `docs` directory.\n\nYou can create a GitHub Actions workflow to perform the export process using the Dendron CLI and push the result to your `pages` branch, triggering a Pages build.\n\nNote that this configuration won't retain any history on the `paths` branch. Paths below are relative to your workspace root.\n\nIgnore the shadow directories in `.gitignore`:\n\n```\ngitignore\n# Dendron\n/docs/assets/\n/docs/notes/\n/docs/_site/\n\n# npm\n/node_modules/\n```\n\nCreate a `package.json` to install the package:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dendron-cli\": \"dendron-cli\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"url\": \"git+https://github.com/LukeCarrier/brain.git\"\n  },\n  \"license\": \"UNLICENSED\",\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@dendronhq/dendron-cli\": \"^0.12.3-alpha.16\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCreate the workflow `.github/workflows/dendron.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nname: Dendron\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n    - master\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout source\n      uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Install npm dependencies\n      run: npm install\n\n    - name: Build pod\n      run: npm run dendron-cli -- buildSite --wsRoot ./ --vault notes/\n\n    - name: Deploy site\n      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n      with:\n        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        publish_branch: pages\n        publish_dir: docs/\n        force_orphan: true\n        enable_jekyll: true\n```\n\nConfigure your repository's Pages settings as follows:\n\n* _Branch_: `pages`\n* _Folder_: _/ (root)_\n\nFinally, commit these three files and push them to your `master` branch. Within a few seconds you should see the workflow run, your `pages` branch get updated and your Pages build start.\n\n### Go back to previous Note\n\nUse \"> Quick Open Previous Recently Used...` to navigate through recently opened notes\n  - default shortcut: `CTRL-TAB`\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tabs.most-recent.gif)\n\n\n### Keep Track of Tabs\n\nIt's really easy to lose sight of your tabs, especially with menu items occluding the little horizontal space you have for tabs. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tabs.nav.jpg)\n\nInstead of relying on the menu, you can use `Show All Editors` to see all tabs via a dropdown. You can also narrow down tabs after selection.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tabs.editors.gif)\n\nYou can streamline this process by assigning a keyboard shortcut to the command. Below is an example.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"key\": \"ctrl+t\",\n    \"command\": \"workbench.action.showAllEditors\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n\n### Copy and Paste Web Content into Dendron\n\nFirst copy it into Notion or use the notion web clipper to clip it. This will format it nicely in markdown. You can then paste it into Dendron with markdown and everything :)\n\n<!-- \n\n### Custom Outlines\n\nTODO: need to add more details\n\nOutlines are super helpful but there are not always feasible depending on the file format\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-21-19-33-21.png)\n\nIn those situations, I like to leave markers inside a note and use the search editor to surface those markers \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/eabf90dbc74e4a1facd5e82bd76a6134\"> \n<p>Tips - Breadcrumbs - Watch Video</p> \n<img style=\"max-width:300px;\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/eabf90dbc74e4a1facd5e82bd76a6134-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/eabf90dbc74e4a1facd5e82bd76a6134\n\nYou can use the same technique \n\n# Generating all journal notes ahead of time\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/25701265/how-to-generate-a-list-of-all-dates-in-a-range-using-the-tools-available-in-bash\n-->\n\n## Workbench\n\n### Remove Markdown Buttons in Menu Bar\n- [discord thread](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/739186036495876126/758408534848831558)\n\n```json\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.bold\": false,\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.italic\": false,\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.strikethrough\": false,\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.bullets\": false,\n```\n\n### Moving Panes\n\nYou can move vscode tabs using the following builtin commands:\n- `View: Move Editor Into Next Group`\n- `View: Move Editor Into Previous Group`\n\nThey are mapped on to the following keyboard shortcuts:\n- mac: `cmd+ctrl+left|right`\n\nThis is helpful for looking at your notes side by side. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/d99ec9cce8ff4d869cf8c36955152808\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/d99ec9cce8ff4d869cf8c36955152808-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Pinning Tabs\n\nYou can pin tabs in VSCode by right clicking on a tab and selecting `Pin Tab`. \n\nThe latest VSCode lets you control pin behavior for tabs. It's not currently documented as of 2020.09.28 but as of the latest insider build, it has a few different options to control the pinned behavior. \n\n- options:\n  - normal (default), normal tab size with a pin icon\n  - shrink: reduced tab size with some text visible\n  - compact: only icon visible\n\n```json\n\"workbench.editor.pinnedTabSizing\": \"shrink\"\n```\n\n\n### Zen Mode\n\nVSCode can be visually noisy. You can hide most of the UI by toggling `Zen Mode` with a three panel layout. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.zen.jpg)\n\nThe following setting overrides are useful: \n\n```json\n// by default, zen mode will open a new \"workspace\" which I don't like\n\"zenMode.fullScreen\": false,\n// I'm a vim user so I like my line numbers\n\"zenMode.hideLineNumbers\": false,\n```\n\nTo navigate tabs and look at the breadcrumb outline, You can use the following commands\n\n```json\nworkbench.action.showAllEditors -> (no shortcut by default, consider mapping to ctrl + t)\nbreadcrumbs.focusAndSelect -> cmd + t\n```\n\nYou can see a video of this workflow in the video below.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/dd27df6d556d4ba6b28b2028ca7d1455\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/dd27df6d556d4ba6b28b2028ca7d1455-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Always show preview of md being edited\n\nSet the following option in your workspace settings\n\n```json\n\"markdown-preview-enhanced.automaticallyShowPreviewOfMarkdownBeingEdited\": true,\n```\n\n\n## Snippets\n\n### Have links auto-complete without additional key presses\n\n- Update your settings to the following\n```json\n// The following settings will only apply to markdown files:\n  \"[markdown]\": {\n    // quickSuggestions true will provide suggestions as you type.\n    // If you turn this on and DO NOT want suggestions\n    // for non-wiki-link, non-tag words,\n    \"editor.quickSuggestions\": true,\n    // This is poorly documented, but seems to offer suggestions\n    // from any word in open document when turned on, which\n    // can be a little distracting in markdown docs:\n    \"editor.wordBasedSuggestions\": false,\n    \"editor.tabSize\": 2,\n    // Set this to false if you turn on quickSuggestions\n    // but don't want suggestions for markdown related snippets\n    // as you type:\n    \"editor.suggest.showSnippets\": false,\n  },\n```\n\n## Markdown\n\n### Always have the preview open\n\n\nYou can add the following setting to your workspace to always have a markdown editor show up with your content. \n\n```json\n\"markdown-preview-enhanced.automaticallyShowPreviewOfMarkdownBeingEdited\": true,\n```\n\n### Symbol search\n\nWhen using the standard file-search in vscode (`ctrl-P`), you can search for all titles in your workspace if you use the starting keyword `#`\n\nExample: if i know i had a header with the title \"cheatsheet\", i can type in `# cheatsheet`\n\n### Auto bullet list\n\nVSCode doesn't support auto-formatting by default. You can use the following workaround to mimic the behavior.\n\n\n- Add list-item below current position. Using `-`\n```json\n{\n        \"key\": \"shift+enter\",\n        \"command\": \"type\",\n        \"args\": {\n            \"text\": \"\\r\\n- \"\n        },\n        \"when\": \"editorTextFocus && !editorReadOnly && editorLangId == 'markdown'\"\n}\n```\n\n- Add list-item below current position. Using `*`\n\n```json\n{\n        \"key\": \"shift+enter\",\n        \"command\": \"type\",\n        \"args\": {\n            \"text\": \"\\r\\n* \"\n        },\n        \"when\": \"editorTextFocus && !editorReadOnly && editorLangId == 'markdown'\"\n}\n```\n\n> Credit for this recipe goes to @Stigs#0135 \n\n\n## Other Tools\n\nThis is a list of other tools that work well with Dendron.\n- [nvAlt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/): local markdown editor that works well with Dendron notes (mac only)\n\n## Other VSCode Extensions\n\n### Git\n- [Git Automator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ivangabriele.vscode-git-add-and-commit): one command to commit and push all changes\n- [Git Doc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.gitdoc): auto-commit and (optionally) auto push your notes at fixed intervals\n- [Gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens): Repository/File/Line history and annotations of all your files\n- [Path AutoComplete](https://github.com/ionutvmi/path-autocomplete): Path autocomplete for VSCode\n\n### Other\n- [Macros](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geddski.macros): Define custom macros \n- [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim): VIM key bindings 😍\n- [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks): Bookmark lines within File [Vertical Limit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=generik.vertical-limit): Work with multiple cursors and blocks of text\n- [CodeUI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanraposo.codeui): Easier customization of every part of the VSCode UI\n\n## Other Browser Extensions\n\n### Web Clipper\n- [Markdown Web](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB): markdown based web clipper\n- [Roam Highlighter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mcoimieglmhdjdoplhpcmifgplkbfibp)\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/692fa114-f798-467f-a0b9-3cccc327aa6f.html","relUrl":"notes/692fa114-f798-467f-a0b9-3cccc327aa6f.html"},{"doc":"Settings","title":"Settings","hpath":"dendron.guides.settings","content":"\n# Settings\n\nYou can update Dendron settings by using the VSCode workspace settings by using the command prompt to `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings`\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/2d8eaeb6fddf4c76a390d3894b497435\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/2d8eaeb6fddf4c76a390d3894b497435-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\nIf you are comfortable with editing raw JSON, you can use `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)` to work with the settings in raw JSON\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/26d66e84-6e4f-4688-bf6e-af070def7c38.html","relUrl":"notes/26d66e84-6e4f-4688-bf6e-af070def7c38.html"},{"doc":"Migration","title":"Migration","hpath":"dendron.guides.migration","content":"\n# Migration\n\nThis note covers migrating your notes from other tools\n\n## Obsidian\n1.

Profit!\n\nSome potential use cases you can do using elasticsearch and Dendron:\n\n- filter your notes by any logical combination of custom attributes\n- make a heatmap of notes created by date\n- get a full list of tags used across your vault and on a per hierarchy basis\n- anything else you can thin of :) \n\nSome useful additional links: \n\n- [elasticsearch docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro.html)\n- [elasticsearch vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ria.elastic)\n\n### Convert timestamps in the frontmatter\n\nCurrently, Dendron notes show timestamps in epoch time which is not the most parsable for humans. You can use the [timestamp converter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Stalinbalraj.timestamp-converter) order to see a human representation of said timestamp.\n\n### Use Dendron with Anki\n\n- [Anki for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jasew.anki)\n\n### Use Dendron on a separate instance of VS Code\n\nYou can use Dendron on a separate instance of VS Code by launching it with the [command line flags](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line#_advanced-cli-options) `--user-data-dir` and `--extensions-dir`:\n\n```\ncode --user-data-dir=/path/to/code-dendron --extensions-dir=/path/to/code-dendron-ext\n```\n\n### Mobile Support\n\nDendron does not have a dedicated mobile client at this time. There are numerous mobile markdown editors that can be used to view and edit Dendron notes. Some popular options are listed below:\n\n- [Git Journal](https://github.com/GitJournal/GitJournal)\n- [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)\n- [Epsilon Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ekartoyev.enotes&hl=en_US&gl=US)\n- [Neutrinote](https://neutrinote.wordpress.com/) (Android only)\n\n\n\nMost mobile apps do not have git support. \n- If you are on iOS, you can follow the instructions [here](https://victoria.dev/blog/a-remote-sync-solution-for-ios-and-linux-git-and-working-copy/) to sync your git backed Dendron with any note taking tool on iOS.\n- If you are on Android, you can read [this writeup](https://mstempl.netlify.app/post/working-with-git-on-android/) by one of users on having Git Sync on Android devices\n\n\n### WebClipper\n\nYou can use the [markdownload-markdown-web](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi) extension to clip content as markdown from Chrome. \n\n### Regex\n\nTo get familiar with regex syntax, try [regexr](https://regexr.com/) is a great place to experiment with different queries.\n\n## Markdown Preview\n\n### Prevent newly opened files from replacing the preview pane?\n\nSet the following option in your workspace settings\n\n```json\n\"markdown-preview-enhanced.automaticallyShowPreviewOfMarkdownBeingEdited\": true,\n```\n\n### Customize Theme\nTo change the color theme, you can update the `markdown-preview-enhanced.previewTheme` vscode setting\n\n### Customize CSS\nYou can see instructions for customizing css [here]( https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/customize-css) \n\n## VSCode\n\n### Use Dendron with a current folder\n\n- 1. start by initializing a workspace\n\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.commands]]#initialize workspace:#*))\n\n- 2. by default, dendron uses a `vaults` folder underneath your workspace to store you vaults. Update your [[settings|dendron.guides.settings]] and change `vault` to the path of your current notes (alternatively, you can also copy your current notes into `vault`)\n\n```\n\"folders\": [\n    {\n        \"path\": \"vault\"\n    },\n    ...\n],\n```\n\n- 3. Run `> Dendron: Reload Index` for Dendron to pick up changes\n\n### Access Dendron Workspace from multiple windows\n\nThere are usually two scenarios:\n\n1. you want two windows of different workspaces\n2. you want two windows of the same workspace\n\n- for 1, create a new window and initialize a new workspace in some directory that is different from your first workspace\n- for 2, you have a few options\n  - a. initialize a new workspace in a different directory. open the settings using `> Open User Workspace settings (JSON)`. change the folder to the path of your vault in the initial workspace. run `> Reload Window` for the changes to take affect\n  - b. use a different version of vscode to open the same workspace (eg. vscode insider, vscodium, vscode regular). you need to do this because vscode will re-use the same window when opening the same workspace\n\n### Change the sorting order in the Outline Panel\n\nClick the three little dots next to outline to change the sorting order. You can sort by **Name** (alphabetical) or **Position** (linear order)\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/cook.vscode.outline.jpg)\n\n### Change the sorting oder in the Explorer Panel\n\nSee instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51543871/sorting-files-in-vs-code-explorer)\n\n### Drag and Drop files into Dendron\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/cook.drag.jpg)\n\nTo drag files into Dendron, open the workspace pane on the side to drag and drop. We currently recommend you only do this for non-markdown files that you want to link to inside your vaults.\n\n## Navigation\n\n### Enable Table of Contents\n\nWhen viewing your notes locally, you can view the toc either from the outline view or by toggling the preview\n\n- from the outline\n  ((ref: [[dendron.topic.workbench]]#outline view,1:#*))\n\n- from the preview\n  ((ref: [[dendron.topic.preview]]#table of contents,1))\n\n## Publishing\n\n### Incremental Builds\n\nYou can do incremental builds from Jekyll and Dendron \n\n- when previewing the site locally, add the `incremental` flag\n  ```bash\n  bundle exec jekyll s --watch --incremental\n  ```\n- when building the site, also add an incremental flag\n  - NOTE: you'll need `rsync` installed to use the incremental flag\n\n```bash\ndendron-cli buildSite --wsRoot {path/to/ws} --vault {path/to/vault} --incremental\n```\n\n### Automatically Update Site while editing\n\nThe following instructions cover how to update your local preview everytime you make a change to your notes\n\n- install `dendron-cli`\n  ((ref: [[dendron.pro.dendron-cli]]#installation,1:#*))\n\n- have jekyll watch your site-root\n\n```bash\ncd {your-site-root}\nbundle exec jekyll s --watch\n```\n\n- use `nodemon` to watch your vault\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g nodemon\nnodemon --watch {path/to/vault} --ext md dendron-cli buildSite --wsRoot {path/to/ws} --vault {path/to/vault}\n```\n\n- NOTE: you can combine this with incremental builds to have the best editing experience\n\n### Publish password protected site using AWS Amplify\n\nYou can click [here](https://main.d19svbygngqnpb.amplifyapp.com/) to see a demo of the end result. \n\nYou can access the site with username: `dendron`, password: `hierarchy`.\n\n- NOTE: this requires hosting your site on AWS. For most people, this will end up costing you a few cents a month. \n\n#### Setup your github repo\n\n1. Create a new github repo using this [template](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-amplify-template/generate).\n2. In your Dendron workspace, remove the `docs` directory and clone your newly created repository \n   ```bash\n   cd {your-workspace}\n   rm -r docs\n   git clone {your-repo} docs\n   ```\n\n#### Setup aws\n\n1. Create an [aws account](https://aws.amazon.com/)\n2. Login to your AWS account and go select the [Amplify Service](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-west-2#/)\n   - ![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/amplify.select.jpg)\n3. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) to connect your github with your amplify\n4. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/access-control.html) to restrict access to your site.\n5. Verify that your site is now password protected\n\n#### Publish your notes\n\n1. Update `siteRepoDir` in `dendron.yml` with the location of your github directory\n   - Your `dendron.yml` should look similar to the one below\n     ```yml\n     site:\n         copyAssets: true\n         siteHierarchies:\n             - root\n         siteRootDir: docs\n         usePrettyRefs: true\n         siteRepoDir: docs\n     ```\n2. Run `> Dendron: Publish` to build your notes for publication and push your notes\n3. Your notes are now published privately behind a password\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/401c5889-20ae-4b3a-8468-269def4b4865.html","relUrl":"notes/401c5889-20ae-4b3a-8468-269def4b4865.html"},{"doc":"Features","title":"Features","hpath":"dendron.features","content":"\n# Features\n## Hierarchies\n\nDendron proposes **hierarchies** as the **human solution** to information overload. This is because there are few things as effective as a multi-level hiearchy for quickly filtering an overwhelming amount of information to something humans can work with. You can read [this blog post](https://kevinslin.com/organizing/its_not_you_its_your_knowledge_base/) for the extended rationale behind this.\n\nIn Dendron, you can quickly **lookup** related notes by their hierarchy. Hierarchies are simply `.` delimited filenames, similar to the hierarchies made by domain names (eg. `github.com`).\n\nThe following are a few notes that have this hierarchical naming format.\n\n```\n- cli.tar.md\n- cli.tar.env.md\n- cli.curl.md\n- cli.dig.md\n```\n\n## Lookup\n\n**Lookup** is the process of finding a note by traversing its hierarchy.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-cli.gif)\n\n> Lookups are **quick**\n\nWhat's nice about using the `.` delimited format is that a note **can be** both **a file** (something that contains data) and **a folder** (something that contains other files) **at the same time**.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-folder_and_file.gif)\n\n> You **can** be a file and have your folder **too**\n\nDendron uses fuzzy matching on paths so you don't have to type out the whole path.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-fuzzy.gif)\n\n> Lazyness is the key to success\n\nYou can use **lookup** to figure out what is true!\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-bool.gif)\n\n## Schemas\n\nIf you're paying close attention, you might have noticed some icons popup during lookup.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-closeup.jpg)\n\nThese icons indicate the **schema** associated with the note. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your information. They describe the hierarchy of your notes and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy.\n\nYou can create a schema by adding a YAML file with the following naming scheme `{name}.schema.yml` to your workspace.\n\nBelow is an example of a three-level hierarchy describing cli commands. You don't need to concern yourself with the details of the schema syntax just yet, just know that this schema will match the following [glob patterns](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/): `cli.*`, `cli.*.cmd`, `cli.*.cmd.*`, `cli.*.env`\n\n```yml\n- id: cli\n  desc: command line interface reference\n  parent: root\n  namespace: true\n  children:\n    - cmd\n    - env\n- id: env\n  desc: variables relevant for command\n- id: cmd\n  desc: subcommands\n  namespace: true\n```\n\nSchemas help you organize your notes by letting you know what comes next.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-suggest.gif)\n\nThe `+` sign next to the suggestion indicates that the note does not exist but is part of the schema.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-plus.jpg)\n\n**Schema suggestions** don't show you an endless lineup of tags or folders - they only show you suggestions scoped to your specific level of the hierarchy that you are looking at.\n\nThe nice thing about these suggestions is that you can also ignore them.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-ignore.gif)\n\n> Sometimes ~~rules~~ schemas are meant to be broken\n\nDendron will show you a `?` next to the result in future results but otherwise will assume that you know best.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-question.jpg)\n\n## VS Code\n\nDendron is built on top of VSCode, the open-source IDE from Microsoft.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/code-banner.jpg)\n\nDendron runs as a plugin inside VSCode. If you use VSCode today, it means that all your current knowledge, settings and extensions will carry over into Dendron. If you don't, no sweat, because Dendron will create an optimal workspace with recommended settings and extensions when you first launch it.\n\n## Recommended Extensions\n\nSince Dendron runs on top of VSCode, it means that you also have access to thousands of extensions to customize Dendron exactly how you like it.\n\nBy default, Dendron will initialize your first workspace with the following extensions and features.\n\n- [Markdown Notes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes)\n  - [wiki links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes)\n  - [tags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes)\n  - [backlinks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes) (think Roam)\n- [Markdown Shortcuts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mdickin.markdown-shortcuts)\n  - Quickly toggle bullet points\n  - Easily generate URLs\n  - Convert tabular data to tables\n- [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)\n  - [live markdown preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)\n  - [math](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/math) (KaTeX or MathJax)\n  - [sequence diagrams](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/diagrams?id=mermaid) (mermaid)\n  - [pandoc support](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/pandoc)\n  - [code chunks](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/code-chunk)\n  - [presentations](https://rawgit.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/master/docs/presentation-intro.html)\n- [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=equinusocio.vsc-material-theme)\n  - beautiful colors built using the [Material design system](https://material.io/)\n- [Paste Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image)\n  - easily add images from your clipboard to your markdown files\n- [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright)\n  - Spell Check\n\n## Additional Features\n\nThe following extensions also work well with Dendron but are not bundled by default.

Dendron is the greek word for tree. It's a reference to the hierarchal note taking that Dendron(3) enables. \n2. Dendron is another word for [dendrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) which is an extension of the nerve cell that sends and receives signals in the brain. Think of Dendron(3) as a digital nervous system that helps you consolidate all the information that you care about in the fastest and most efficient way possible.\n    ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg/2880px-Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg.png)\n    - Image by Quasar Jarosz at English Wikipedia\n3. Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you organize, manage, publish, and collaborate on knowledge bases of any size.\n\n### How is Dendron different from X note taking tool?\n\nSubstitute X with `roam|obsidian|foam|one note|evernote|...`\n\nAll note taking tools (try to make it) easy to get notes in. Its getting it back out again that's hard and it **becomes harder** as you get more notes.\n\nWhether you are using notebooks tags, or backlinks, once you have more than a few hundred notes, you'll need to have some sort of structure in place (eg. naming convention, hierarchy, etc) to keep track of it. \n\nDendron is a highly opinionated note taking tool that focuses on **hierarchal note taking**. It provides the freedom of Roam's *every note exists everywhere philosophy* while layering on top **flexible hierarchies** to keep track of it all. \n\nWhile Dendron works with knowledge bases of any size, it really shines once you've accumulated a few hundred notes. I created it to handle my personal knowledge base of 20k+ markdown notes - Dendron lets me track and find any specific note in it in seconds. You can read more about Dendron's hierarchal approach to note taking [here](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html).\n\n### How does Dendron help me track my notes?\n\n1. Dendron organizes and collapse all your  notes into managable chunks using [[hierarchies |dendron.topic.hierarchies]].\n2. Dendron helps you manage your hiearchies using [[schemas | dendron.topic.schema ]]\n3. Dendron gets out of your way when your working with your notes during [[lookup |dendron.topic.lookup]]\n\nDendron's secret sauce is that it provides the necessary tooling for you to work with hierarichal notes. While hierarchies have traditionally (and justifiably) gotten a bad, I would argue that this is because the **tooling** around hierarchies were bad, not because hierarchies themselves are bad. \n\nHierarchies are one of the most effective ways that **both humans and computers** process large amount of information (there's a reason why almost every database is built from a variation of the [b-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree)). You can find further details about hierarchies in this [blog post](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/e1455752-b052-4212-ac6e-cc054659f2bb.html)\n\n### Is Dendron Free? Will it stay free?\n\nDendron, the client, is free and will always remain free. It is also open source so anyone is free to make their own fork of Dendron.\n\nThat being said, I'm all in on Dendron and this is my full time gig. I want to make sure that developing Dendron remains sustainable. To that end, I plan on introducing value add server side functionality that folks may pay for. Examples of paid for features include: \n\n- private hosting (for folks who want to publish but not use github pages or want to add authentication)\n- enterprisy things \n    - eg. on premise installations of Dendron with single sign on, active directory, and fine grained permissions\n- offering private subscription based vaults (eg. think [substack](https://substack.com) but having people subscribe to vaults instead of newsletters )\n- server side IFTTT like functionality (eg. everytime I add an entry to airtable, add a note to Dendron)\n\nPaid for features will be 100% optional and will not be necessary for any client side functionality in Dendron.\n\n### Why is Dendron built on top of VSCode?\n\nAs with all things, its a matter of tradeoffs. Dendron started its life as a standalone app (eg. think Obsidian) but I quickly realized I was spending most of my time building undifferentiated editor scaffolding instead of focusing on the hierarchies and schemas that made Dendron unique.\n\nI wanted to spend more time building out features that supported Dendron's [hiearchy first approach](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html) to note taking which is what led me to re-write it for VSCode. \n\nThat being said, the core dendron engine is not vscode specific and there are folks that are experimenting with porting it over to other editors (eg. sublime, vim). We also have plans for a standalone editor in the future (most likely, this will be a fork of VSCode optimized for note taking)\n\n\n## Working with Notes\n\n### Why markdown?\n\nMarkdown lets you write text in a simple human readable notation that is platform independent. You don't need to have microsoft word to read a markdown file and now a days, all new note taking tools support importing and displaying markdown.\n\nFor more context, you can see the original markdown declaration [here]( https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) \n\n### Can I use Dendron with existing notes?\n\nYou can use Dendron with existing repositories of markdown notes.\n\nOpen the `Command Bar` in vscode and use the `Dendron: Change Workspace` command. It will ask you for a folder path as input.\n\nDendron will create a `dendron.code-workspace` file in specified directory and then open the workspace (if a workspace file already exists, it will use that). It will also create a `root.md` file in that directory if it doesn't exist (currently this is part of the internal working of dendron).\n\nDendron **does not** delete or overwrite any files during the **Change Workspace** operation.\n\n### How do I save?\n\nDendron automatically saves when you change focus (switch tabs or applications). You can also manually save using `Cmd+S` or `Ctrl+S` depending on your operating system\n\n### How do I go back to the previous note?\n\nThere are 3 ways to go back to my previous note: \n1. `ctrl-tab` (go to previous tab)\n2. click on the previous tab\n3. using the open editors pane \n\n- NOTE: to have more than a single tab show, you need to have the following settings\n```json\n{\n    \"workbench.editor.enablePreview\": false,\n    \"workbench.editor.showTabs\": true\n}\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/faq.go-back.gif)\n\n## Working with Hierarchies\n\n### How should I name a note?\n\nThere are no rigid requirements on note naming in Dendron, other than the dots in the file name are used to construct the note [[note hierarchy|dendron.topic.hierarchies]]. However, the recommended way is to use all lowercase letters, replace spaces with `-`-mark and remove any special characters. Thus e.g. `John's amazing garage` becomes `johns-amazing-garage`.\n\nAlso, remember that you will use the note [[lookup-feature|dendron.topic.lookup]] to find notes quickly, and the lookup will use the names of the files. Thus try to name the files using the words that you are likely to use to find the note.\n\n### What kind of note hierarchy should I create?\n\nA good guideline is to start with a relatively flat hierarchy (even just a single note in the root!) and add topics as headings into those notes. When notes grow to the point that you have to start scrolling, it’s time to consider if it would be beneficial to split those notes. At that point, you probably already have some idea how the thoughts are placed in your mind - try to mimic that also with the hierarchy.\n\nIf you have a hard time deciding which ideas belong closer to root, think which of those ideas are more fundamental in your thinking. As an example, a note related to coding in Excel, should it be named as `code.excel` or `excel.code`? This could be resolved by thinking if you will write more about coding where Excel is just one example, or more about Excel, where coding is only one example. In case you think that both `excel.code` and `code.excel` are equal and both should be created, you could also make one of them a “master note” and [[refer|dendron.topic.refs]] to it from the other note.\n\n### Do I have to use hierarchies? What if I want to use another approach?\n\nDespite our emphasis on hierarchies, Dendron also supports non-hierarchal ways of organizing notes (eg. backlinks, zettelkasten, etc).\n\nYou can, and are encouraged to, combine these other workflows with Dendron hierarchies in order to create your own workflow that takes the best parts of each system!\n\n### What if I have a note that belongs in multiple hierarchies?\n\nThis comes up a lot especially when your dealing with organizing collections of things, like music or books. There are a few approaches we recommend here.\n\n1. Use [[tags|dendron.topic.tags]]. Tags work best with categorical data. If you use **Dendron Tags** (aka they're really hierarchies), then you have the added advantage of being able to refactor and track your tags using Dendron's existing hierarchal tooling. \n2. Use alias nodes. This is an [upcoming feature](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/128) that will allow you to put a node under multiple hierarchies. \n\n## Working with Schemas\n\n### What is the deal with schemas? Do I need to use them?\n\nThe short answer is no, you don't **need** to use schemas. That being said, schemas can help you manage your notes, especially as you collect more of them.\n\nIf you're familiar with typescript - Dendron schemas are similar to the types offered by typescript. You can compile your typescript code into javascript even if the types don't match (subject to your tsconfig). Types help make your projects maintainable, especially as they grow.\n\nCurrently, Dendron will do is show you an indicator if your schema doesn't match. In the future, we'll have a strict mode where we will actually prevent you from creating notes that don't match your schema.\n\nSchemas at the end of the day help you construct consistent hierarchies for your notes. Consistent hierarchies alleviate the cognitive overhead of needing to understand and track N things where N can be very big. Instead, you can construct a single schema that encompasses the common areas of all N things.\n\nBut even if you don't have a lot of notes, schemas are helpful because they provide extra features [like templating](https://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#schema-templates) and [auto complete](https://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#why-use-schemas).\n\n<!-- \nThis allows you to quickly reference anything within your hierarchy because they all have the same shape. It also helps with understanding a topic - I (Kevin, Dendron author) find my schema for a domain tends to reflect my mental model for said domain as well.\n\nFor example, I'm using nodejs and need to access a file. I have no idea what the builtin/recommended library for file access is. Instead of having to dig up [fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra), I can navigate to `l.node.file` and see my notes on the best way to work with files. You can replace node with any other programming language. Now I have a general way of referencing file access for all languages without needing to remember the specific implementation detail of any of them.\n-->\n\n## Finding Notes\n\n### Can I do filter by the metadata in Dendron?\n\nMetadata is currently under utilized because we don't have a built in way of easily querying by it. We currently have [this issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/152) tracking the progress of advanced query work.\n\nIn the future, we want to support:\n- querying by custom frontmatter attributes: https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/152\n- query by attributes with logical operators: https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/159\n\nWe also want to support some subset of the queries as note references so that the results can be included in page.\n\n## Other\n\n### Why are there `root` files in my notes?\n\nWhen you initialize a vault, `root.md` and `root.schema.yml` get created inside each vault.\n\nThey serve as the \"roots\" of your vault for your notes and schema respectively.\n\nroot.md is used as the parent of all hierarchies, root.schema as the parent of all schemas\n\nroot.md is what shows up when you do a lookup with an empty line \"\"\n\nroot.schema.yml is a schema that is global for all hierarchies (normally, a schema is scoped to a particular hierarchy)\n\nNow this isn't required per-say, we could just do away with **root** notes and stick strictly to hierarchies and this might be an option in the future but this is the reasoning at the current time\n\nps. root.schema.yml doesn't work right now as described in the sense that we haven't implemented global schemas yet\n\n\n### Can I use a dark theme for the markdown preview?\n\nYes. There's a setting called `markdown-preview-enhanced.previewTheme` that you can set which has a list of default themes, including dark themes. \n\n### Can I customize the markdown preview CSS?\n\nYes. Read [this](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/customize-css) for more information.\n\n### Is there a list of keyboard shortcuts I can see? \n\nDendron has a list of keyboard shortcuts that you can access using `Dendron: Show Help` command. Note that these only show the commands that come with the Dendron Plugin but not its bundled extensions. We currently have an open [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/148) to list all shortcuts on one page. \n\n### Why are there '+' signs next to the notes in the Tree View?\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/faq.plus-sign.jpg)\n\nThe reason you see this is because Dendron will create [[stub|dendron.concepts#stubs]] notes when creating notes that have parents that don't exist. These notes are placeholders and will only be visible in the Dendron Tree View with a `+` sign next to the name. The reason we do stubs is because we don't want to litter your file system with empty files. Stubs are a compromise - they let you see the hierarchy of your newly created notes without forcing you to create intermediary files.\n\n### Why custom markdown preview instead of the VSC one? \n\nOur custom markdown preview gives us much more functionality then the vscode one -> eg. note references, checkboxes, etc.\n\nIn addition, the markdown preview that Dendron uses is platform agnostic (eg. it's also available on atom). This means that other editors could potentially adopt it as well.\n\n\n### VSCode Snippets are not working in Frontmatter\n\nThe default snippets are scoped to markdown. You can create [global snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets) file to have snippets that work across all languages.\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/683740e3-70ce-4a47-a1f4-1f140e80b558.html","relUrl":"notes/683740e3-70ce-4a47-a1f4-1f140e80b558.html"},{"doc":"Development","title":"Development","hpath":"dendron.dev","content":"\n# Development\n\nIf you would like to contribute to the development of dendron, you can do so by checkout out the [repo](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron) from github.\n\nYou can then follow the setup instructions below to prepare your first commit!\n\n((ref: [[dendron.dev.setup]]#getting started))\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/3489b652-cd0e-4ac8-a734-08094dc043eb.html","relUrl":"notes/3489b652-cd0e-4ac8-a734-08094dc043eb.html"},{"doc":"Testing","title":"Testing","hpath":"dendron.dev.testing","content":"\n# Testing\n\n## Running All Tests\n\n### All packages except the plugin\n\n- Inside VSCode\n> Run Task: Test (bootstrap)\n\n- Using CLI\n```bash\n./bootstrap/scripts/test-all.sh\n```\n\n\n### Run all test for Dendron Plugin (plugin-core)\n\n1.

Requirements\nBefore you begin, you need to make sure to have the following SDKs and tools:\n\n- [Node.js >= 12.0.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v10.x/)\n  - We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)\n\n### 2. Clone and npm install\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron.git\ncd dendron\nnpm install\n```\n\n### 3. Build Repo\n\n- you should run this when building dendron for the first time and also every time you run a git pull\n  - new dependencies might have been picked up between pulls and this makes sure that they are installed\n\n```bash\n./bootstrap/scripts/init.sh\n```\n\n- we recommend you use `vscode` to develop for dendron. there is a `dendron.code-workspace` file in the root of the monorepo that you should use when developing\n\n### 4. Start Debugging (the plugin)\n- NOTE: you don't need to do this if you are not directly working on the extension (eg. you're working on the [[server|dendron.pro.dendron-next-server]])\n\nTo start an instance of the Dendron with the Debugger, Run `Extension (plugin-core)` from the debug panel in vscode\n\n![debugger](/assets/images/start_debugger.gif)\n\n_Note: Running via Run -> Start Debugging will not work unless you've previously targeted `Extension (plugin-core)`_\n\n\n## Tips\n\nTo continuously compile all dependencies, run the following\n\n```bash\n./bootstrap/scripts/watch.sh\n```\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Something went wrong during the build\nIn case something something goes wrong with a build step or you want to save time by not running everything, `init.sh` is just a thin wrapper around the following scripts, each of which can be run individually\n\n- ./bootstrap/scripts/bootstrap.sh: `lerna bootstrap all packages`\n- ./bootstrap/scripts/build.sh: `lerna build all packages`\n- initialize template repo (this bundles the latest [dendron-template](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-template) with the plugin so that the right notes are initialized when a user creates their first workspace)\n```bash\n cd packages/plugin-core/\n ./scripts/sync_vault.sh\n```\n\n\n### Changes not showing up in Dendron\n1. Are you using the `Run extension` command on the debugger panel to test dendron? \n\n2. If you have one vscode instance which you have dendron installed and are also doing dendron development on, you might get a version conflict. in that case, use `Run extension with plugin disabled` in the debugger panel (or use a different version of vscode to run dendron vs develop)\n\n## Testing\n- see [[Testing|dendron.dev.testing]]\n\n## Debugging\n- see [[Debugging|dendron.dev.debug]]\n\n## Style\n- see [[Style|dendron.dev.style]]","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/64f0e2d5-2c83-43df-9144-40f2c68935aa.html","relUrl":"notes/64f0e2d5-2c83-43df-9144-40f2c68935aa.html"},{"doc":"Ref","title":"Ref","hpath":"dendron.dev.ref","content":"\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/b5736273-85ad-4d0c-bb30-89c92a3941da.html","relUrl":"notes/b5736273-85ad-4d0c-bb30-89c92a3941da.html"},{"doc":"Vscode","title":"Vscode","hpath":"dendron.dev.ref.vscode","content":"\n\n## Debug Pane\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/dev.vscode-debug.jpg)","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/3307c16e-69d9-48cd-b1cc-1dfe88274191.html","relUrl":"notes/3307c16e-69d9-48cd-b1cc-1dfe88274191.html"},{"doc":"Lifecylce","title":"Lifecylce","hpath":"dendron.dev.ref.lifecylce","content":"\n\n# Extension\n- not_initialized\n    - tried starting workspace but something went wrong\n- initialized\n    - reloadWorkspace complete\n    - **upgraded**\n    - upgrade workspace complete\n- upgraded (optional)\n    - extension has upgraded\n- activate\n    - finish showWelcome\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/5e164216-c464-4a6f-ae85-a6f5cbc787e7.html","relUrl":"notes/5e164216-c464-4a6f-ae85-a6f5cbc787e7.html"},{"doc":"Issues","title":"Issues","hpath":"dendron.dev.issues","content":"\n# Issues\n\n### gyp issue when installing\n\n- Call to 'krb5-config gssapi --libs' returned exit status 127 while in binding.gyp. while trying to load binding.gyp\n\n```bash\nyum install make glibc-devel gcc patch\n```","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/af2ba46a-4dbc-4648-9d4c-f6d6d2e3bb50.html","relUrl":"notes/af2ba46a-4dbc-4648-9d4c-f6d6d2e3bb50.html"},{"doc":"Design","title":"Design","hpath":"dendron.dev.design","content":"\n# Design\n\n## Major Components\n\n### Dendron Engine \n- [repo](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/tree/master/packages/engine-server)\n\nThis is responsible for Dendron's hierarchal index and lookup capabilities.

The syntax is evolving but here is a loosely documented starting point:\n- @: equivalent of `this.`\n- $: referencing a global variable\n- `...`: code that is omitted because it would clutter the summary\n- `=:` magic equality, \n\nThe places where you see this convention being broken (eg. actual valid typescript) are areas where the author got lazy and just copied code into the summary. Try to not do this because that defeats the point of a *summarized* view. That being said, Dendron is all about being pragmatic and taking an iterative approach to things. \n\n# Initializing the Engine\n\n## Summary\n- engine.query\n  - store.query\n    - FileParser.parse\n      ```ts\n      allFiles {\n        getFileMeta\n        toNode\n      }\n      ```\n    -

This is because lerna symlinks mono-repo dependencies together and a `yarn add` would override that. Instead, use the following command:\n\n```\nlerna add {package-to-install} --scope @dendronhq/{package-to-install-into}\n```\n\nBecause this is typescript, don't forget to also install the `@types` package if it exists\n\n```bash\nlerna add @types/{package-to-install} --scope @dendronhq/{package-to-install-into}\n```\n\n### Add a new node package\n\n- initialize repo\n\n```bash\ncd {workspace_dir}\ncp -R /path/to/dendron-yeoman/node-ts packages/{new-package}\n```\n\n- update `package.json`\n\n  - change project name\n\n- publish the repo (needs to be done initially before running lerna publish)\n\n```\nnpm publish --access public\n```\n\n### Using eslint\n\nAll packages in the repo use a standard base configuration found at [.eslintrc.js](.eslintrc.js). If you're using the VS Code and would like to see eslint violations on it, install the [eslint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).\n\n\n### Add a new site config option\n\nThe following is an example of controlling formatting options to the DendronSiteConfig. You can see the [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/278) for more details.\n\nDendron currently will auto-format notes during `Rename` and `Refactor` operations when links inside a note need to be replaced.\n\nThe formatting options are defined [here](https://dendron.so/notes/849ee8ee-05a5-47bf-b44d-d7c257117bc4.html#renaming-a-note).\n\nThese are [rough notes](https://dendron.so/notes/849ee8ee-05a5-47bf-b44d-d7c257117bc4.html#flow) of how formatting gets called during rename\n\nTo make this customizable, the following changes need to be made:\n\n- [ ] update the [DendronConfig type definition](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/types.ts#L405:L405)\n- [ ] update [config defaults](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/config.ts#L42:L42)\n- [ ] pass in formatting options from the [plugin](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/commands/RenameNoteV2a.ts#L137:L137)\n- [ ] accept formatting args in the [server](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/api-server/src/routes/note.ts#L38:L38)\n- [ ] accept formatting args in the [engine](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/enginev2.ts#L249:L249)\n- [ ] accept it when [replacing links](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/topics/markdown/utilsv2.ts#L85:L85)\n- [ ] accept it in [remark pipeline](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/topics/markdown/utilsv2.ts#L41:L41)\n\n\nWhen all this is done, we can add tests that the formatting behavior works\n- [ ] [engine tests](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/__tests__/enginev2.spec.ts#L652:L652)\n- [ ] [plugin test](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/test/suite-integ/RenameNoteV2.test.ts#L157:L157)\n\nThe above changes are for `Rename`. `Refactor` calls rename in a loop so changing rename should update refactor as well.","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/a80f36d9-01d0-4c5a-a228-867b093a4913.html","relUrl":"notes/a80f36d9-01d0-4c5a-a228-867b093a4913.html"},{"doc":"Api","title":"Api","hpath":"dendron.dev.api","content":"\n# API\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/348fc5c7-e1ba-4fa2-ab6d-a3c94628fa11.html","relUrl":"notes/348fc5c7-e1ba-4fa2-ab6d-a3c94628fa11.html"},{"doc":"Seeds","title":"Seeds","hpath":"dendron.dev.api.seeds","content":"\n# Seeds\n((ref: [[dendron.topic.seeds]]#seeds 🚧,1:#*))\n\n# DendronSeed\n\nBase class to extend from when creating a new seed.

Note that features with 🚧 are still under active development and might not be fully implemented.\n\n### Markdown\n\nDendron supports markdown, a popular markup syntax that is like HTML but 1000x simpler. If you are new to markdown, you can read about the syntax [here](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown).\n\n### Frontmatter\n\nFrontmatter is a convenient way of adding extra information to your documents like a shorthand title or longer description (think any extra information you can use to describe a note). This type of information is generally called metadata and the structure used is called [YAML](https://yaml.org/). You can add it to the front of your markdown file and it won't show up in the preview. It was first introduced by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). \n\nYou can read more about the frontmatter used in Dendron [[here |dendron.topic.frontmatter]]\n\n### Workspace\nIn Dendron, your **workspace** is the root of where all your files are located. It's set when you first run `Dendron: Initialize Workspace`. The folder that contains your workspace is also known as your **workspace root**.\n\n### Vaults 🚧\nYour workspace is made up of **vaults**. A dendron vault stores a collection of related notes. If you're familiar with git, it's just like a code repo. By default, Dendron creates a *vaults* folder when you first initialize a **workspace**. All your notes are stored on a per vault basis.\n\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    ├── vault.main\n    │   ├── foo.md\n    │   ├── foo.one.md\n    │   └── foo.two.md\n    └── vault.secret (hypothetical)\n        ├── secret.one.md\n        └── secret.two.md\n```\n\nBy default, when you look for notes in Dendron, it will search over all vaults.\n\n### Workspace Configuration\nWorkspace configuration is located directly underneath the **workspace root**.  By convention, the default configuration is going to be in a folder titled **config**. This is also called the **configuration root**. A workspace can have multiple configurations that initializes your workspace with a different subset of vaults.\n\n### Hierarchies\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.hierarchies]]#Hierarchies,1:#Concepts))\n\nYou can read more about hierarchies [[here|dendron.topic.hierarchies]]\n\n### Domain\n\nA domain is the root of a hierarchy. In the example below, `project1` would be the domain.\n\n\n```\n.\n├── project1.md\n├── project1.designs.md\n├── project1.designs.promotion.md\n├── project1.paperwork.md\n├── project1.paperwork.legal.md\n├── project1.tasks.md\n├── project1.tasks.task1.md\n└── project1.tasks.task2.md\n```\n\n### Schema  \n\nAs you end up creating more notes, it can be hard to keep track of it all. This is why Dendron has **schemas** to help you manage your notes. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your information. They describe the hierarchy of your notes and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy. \n\nYou can create a schema by adding a YAML file with the following naming scheme `{name}.schema.yml` to your workspace. \n\nBelow is an example of a three-level hierarchy describing cli commands. You don't need to concern yourself with the details of the schema syntax just yet, just know that this schema will match the following [glob patterns](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/): `cli.*`, `cli.*.cmd`, `cli.*.cmd.*`, `cli.*.env`\n\n```yml\n- id: cli\n  desc: command line interface reference\n  parent: root\n  namespace: true\n  children cmd\n    - env\n- id: env\n  desc: variables relevant for command\n- id: cmd\n  desc: subcommands \n  namespace: true\n```\n\n### Stubs\n\nStubs are notes that don't exist but that you might want to create. They will show up as suggestions in lookup results.\nThere are two reasons why these suggested notes might show up: \n- they are the uncreated parent of a note deeper in the hierarchy (eg. `foo.bar` might be a stub for `foo.bar.foobar`)\n- they are possible notes according to the schema\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-plus.jpg)\n> The `+` sign next to the suggestion indicates that the note is a stub and does not exist \n\n### Pods 🚧\n\n[[Pods |dendron.topic.pod]] are the mechanisms Dendron uses to import and export notes. Dendron has a different pod depending on where you are getting and publishing your data to. \n\n\n### Command Bar\n\nThe command bar is native to `vscode`. You can use it to run dendron commands, which will all be prefixed with `Dendron:`. You can use the following shortcut to open the command bar. \n\n- <img src=\"https://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/favicon.png\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf\">Linux</a> `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n- <img src=\"https://developer.apple.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf\">macOS</a> `Cmd+Shift+P`\n- <img src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf\">Windows</a> `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n\n\n### Lookup Bar\n\nThe lookup bar is how you interact with notes inside of Dendron. Use it to create, find, and delete notes. You can type `> Dendron: Lookup` in the `Command Bar` or use the `Ctrl+L` shortcut. \n\n- <img src=\"https://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/favicon.png\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf\">Linux</a> `Ctrl+L`\n- <img src=\"https://developer.apple.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf\">macOS</a> `Cmd+L`\n- <img src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf\">Windows</a> `Ctrl+L`\n\n![](assets/2020-07-07-20-14-57.png)\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html","relUrl":"notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html"},{"doc":"Community","title":"Community","hpath":"dendron.community","content":"\n# Community\n\nDendron wouldn't be what it is today without its wonderful users.\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/6f4cd441-f883-4e75-871b-b7f93895c91b.html","relUrl":"notes/6f4cd441-f883-4e75-871b-b7f93895c91b.html"},{"doc":"Showcase","title":"Showcase","hpath":"dendron.community.showcase","content":"\n# Showcase\n\nBelow are examples of published Dendron vaults\n\n## Official\n### Dendron homepage\n- homepage: https://dendron.so\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-09-05-45.png)\n\n### Open PKM Catalogue\n- homepage: https://pkm.dendron.so\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/showcase.pkm.jpg)\n\n### Open AWS Catalogue\n- homepage: https://aws.dendron.so\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/showcase.aws.jpg)\n\n## Members\n\n### Kevin's page\n- homepage: https://kevinslin.com/\n- discord: `@kevins8#0590`\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-08-45-00.png)\n\n### Ed's Page\n- homepage: https://ens100.github.io/\n- discord: `@edns100#4851`\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-09-04-36.png)\n\n### Jack's page\n- homepage: https://jackqaq-byte.github.io/my-second-brain/\n- discord: `@I'm a lightbulb#6986`\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-09-01-48.png)\n\n### Luke's second brain\n- homepage: https://luke.carrier.im/\n- discord: `@lukecarrier#2081`\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-27-20-50-54.png)\n\n### Ian's digital garden\n- homepage: https://garden.ianjones.us/\n- discord: `@ianjones#3696`\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-12-06-09-43-31.png)\n\n### Kevin's digital garden (another one)\n- homepage: garden.kevincunningham.co.uk\n- discord: `@dolearning (Kevin)#3551`\n\n![ScreenShot of @dolearning digital garden](https://res.cloudinary.com/kc-cloud/image/upload/v1607614868/digital_garden_screenshot_j9wrcz.png)\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/3a82c5ff-7945-46ae-8bf9-3b2275fc6642.html","relUrl":"notes/3a82c5ff-7945-46ae-8bf9-3b2275fc6642.html"},{"doc":"Roles","title":"Roles","hpath":"dendron.community.roles","content":"\n# Roles\n\nDendron has special roles for members of its community. \n\n## Dendrologist\n**Dendrologist** are active members of the Dendron community.
